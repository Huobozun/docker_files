A control group consisted of 30 healthy children free of any disease. All children underwent conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography initially and at the time of the follow-up examination.', 'Myocardial systolic wave velocity of the mitral annulus was significantly higher in patients with mitral regurgitation of grade two or more when compared to the control group, but was not different between patients with mild mitral regurgitation and healthy subjects at the time of the initial attack. Myocardial precontraction time, myocardial contraction time, and the ratio of myocardial precontraction and contraction times were significantly prolonged, and the systolic myocardial velocity of the mitral annulus was significantly decreased in patients with mitral regurgitation of grade two or more at the time of the follow-up examination. The myocardial systolic wave velocity was significantly lower, and myocardial precontraction time, myocardial contraction time, and the ratio of the precontraction and contraction times, were significantly longer or greater between patients with grade two or more mitral regurgitation and the control group at follow-up examination.', 'We detected subclinical systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle in children with a primary episode of rheumatic carditis due to ongoing ventricular volume overload. Tissue Doppler imaging provides a quantifiable indicator useful for cardiac monitoring of disease during the period of follow up.']
['Characterization of ST80 Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone in Tunisia.', 'The spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has been reported in communities worldwide. In this study, we characterized 64 Tunisian CA-MRSA by agr typing, polymerase chain reaction assay for 20 virulence genes, staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and protein A gene (spa) typing. All our isolates were lukS-PV-lukF-PV positive, etd positive, and edin positive. They harbored SCCmec type IV and belonged to agr group 3. PFGE typing showed that our isolates were distributed in 11 different pulsotypes. spa typing and MLST, performed with isolates representative of each PFGE pattern, revealed that all isolates had a unique spa type (t044) and a common sequence type (ST80). The isolates showed susceptibility to the majority of antibiotics, and resistance to kanamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline, but intermediate resistance to fusidic acid. Full analysis of our results revealed that our isolates were nonmultiresistant and belonged to a single clonal type ST80.']

['A spectroscopic method to determine the activity of the restriction endonuclease EcoRV that involves a single reaction.', 'A one-step protocol is presented to determine the activity of EcoRV as a model of restriction enzymes. The protocol involved a molecular beacon as DNA substrate, with the target sequence recognized by EcoRV in the stem. EcoRV cleaved the stem forming two fragments, one of which contained the fluorophore and quencher, initially bound by 3 bp. This shorter fragment rapidly dissociated at 37 °C, causing an increase of fluorescence intensity that was used to gauge the reaction kinetics. The reaction can be described using the Michaelis-Menten mechanism, and the kinetic parameters obtained were compared with literature values involving other protocols.']

['Evaluation of five scoring systems for cervical spondylogenic myelopathy.', 'Comparison of measured clinical deficits and outcomes is vital for international discussion about the identification and treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). There is currently little information comparing outcomes as assessed by different CSM scoring systems.', 'To qualitatively and quantitatively analyze five specific CSM outcome scores that are frequently used to assess the grade of severity and outcome after operative decompression.', 'This retrospective study evaluated the Nurick score, the Japanese Orthopedic Association score (JOA score), the Cooper myelopathy scale (CMS), the Prolo score, and the European myelopathy score (EMS).', 'The study included 43 patients with clinical and morphological signs of CSM, who underwent ventral decompression. Data were evaluated in sufficient detail to objectively assess the scores.', 'Clinical findings (funicular and radicular symptoms), recovery rate, symptom duration, age, economic situation, time away from employment, somatic-evoked potentials, and radiological findings were assessed.', 'Scores were assessed using both pre- and postoperative clinical data. Correlations between scores, score improvement, and how well the scores reflected the clinical, diagnostic, and anamnestic data were analyzed using nonparametric, descriptive statistical tests. The recovery rate, as a measure of cumulative outcome, was also assessed and compared for each scoring system.', "All five scores were suitable for qualitatively assessing the clinical characteristics and progression of cervical myelopathy. All showed a statistically significant correlation (p<.05), and measured postoperative improvement (p<.001). All scores also reflected clinical deficits except for the Prolo score, which rates the severity of CSM with an emphasis on data related to the economic impact on the patient's situation rather than on clinical symptoms per se. Quantitative assessment of clinical symptom improvement varied greatly among the scores, for example, Nurick score (33%) versus JOA score (81%). The recovery rates, as a measure of cumulative improvement, showed less variation among most of the scores. The Nurick score and the EMS measured clinical deficit improvements in significantly fewer patients than did the JOA score (p<.05).", 'Evaluating the recovery rate is essential for comparing the results of the five CSM scores evaluated in this study. There was a large quantitative difference among the scores as the result of the different criteria used to produce each score. Qualitatively, all five scores allowed evaluation of cervical myelopathy, but only the recovery rate allowed for statistical comparison. Advancements in the treatment of CSM depend on the ability of clinicians to evaluate the therapeutic results of CSM studies. This study suggests that using the recovery rate to assess outcome is best for comparing studies that use different scores.']

A case report with four-year follow-up.', 'This case report describes the outcome of straight endograft placement for treating a large para-anastomotic aortic aneurysm (PAA). A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department because of a vast PAA (8.7 cm in maximum transverse diameter). Since 1983, she has undergone multiple vascular operations for arterial occlusive disease. In 1990, an aortobifemoral bypass operation was performed. In this most recent intervention, we implanted three tube Excluder? endografts. The procedure was uneventful. Considering the size of the aneurysm sac, particular attention was paid to possible sequelae during the over 4-year follow-up period. No complications developed and the last computed tomography (CT) scan showed a remarkable decrease of 50 mm in aneurysm size. In conclusion, the use of straight endografts seems to be effective and lasting, even in large para-anastomotic aneurysmatic lesions.']

The aim of the present study was to explore the relation of visfatin concentrations to cardiovascular risk factors and serum adipocytokine concentrations in patients with impaired fasting glucose.', 'A sample of 55 patients with impaired fasting glucose was analyzed in a prospective way. All patients with a 2-wk weight-stabilization period before recruitment were enrolled. Weight, blood pressure, basal glucose, lipoprotein(a), C-reactive protein, insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triacylglycerols, blood, and adipocytokines (visfatin, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], and interleukin-6) levels were measured. Tetrapolar impedancometry, indirect calorimetry, and prospective serial assessment of nutritional intake with 3-d written food records were performed.', 'Fourteen men (25.5%) and 41 women (74.5%), with a mean age of 57.3 ± 11.7 y and mean body mass index of 35.8 ± 3.6 kg\\/m(2), were included.

['Comparison of Two Different Programmes of Ovulation Synchronization in the Treatment of Ovarian Cysts in Dairy Cows.', 'It was the aim of this field study to evaluate two different protocols of ovulation synchronization for the treatment of ovarian cysts and their effect on reproductive performance in dairy cows. In addition, factors with a possible influence on treatment success and pregnancy outcome as well as costs per pregnancy were analysed. The study was performed with 130 German Holsteins with ovarian cysts diagnosed on days 55 to 60 postpartum. Cows belonging to group 1 (n = 65) received a modified ovsynch protocol [day 0: 0.15 mg cloprostenol (PGF) + 0.02 mg buserelin acetate (GnRH); day 14: PGF; day 16: GnRH]. Group 2 (n = 65) was treated with the conventional ovsynch protocol (day 0: GnRH; day 7: PGF; day 9: GnRH). Timed artificial insemination was performed 20 to 24 h later. Cows without ovarian cysts served as controls. Treatment success (disappearance of the ovarian cyst) after the first ovsynch cycle was higher in group 1 (66.2%) than in group 2 (23.1%, p < 0.05). Reproductive measures in group 1 were comparable with those of the control group and, compared with group 2, were conspicuously better (66.2%, 76.9%, 83.1%, 59.5% vs. 40.0%, 50.7%, 60.0%, 27.5% for cumulative pregnancy rate after treatment cycle 1 to 3 and second service conception rate, respectively, p < 0.05). Overconditioned cows and cows with larger ovarian cysts showed a diminished treatment and pregnancy success. In group 1, costs per pregnancy were only slightly higher than in the control group (group 1: ?352.44, group 2: ?484.59, control group: ?333.77). In conclusion, our results suggest that ovsynch protocols can be used in the treatment of ovarian cysts. The modified ovsynch protocol led to a better cure rate as well as a better reproductive performance, and was economically beneficial compared with a conventional ovsynch protocol.']
['Allometric modeling of ciclesonide, a nonhalogenated glucocorticoid, and its active metabolite, desisobutyrylciclesonide, using animal-derived pharmacokinetic parameters.', 'Ciclesonide, a novel glucocorticosteroid, through a rapid metabolism to desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-ciclesonide), provides an effective treatment option for asthma episodes by the inhaled route of administration. The availability of pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance [CL\\/F]; volume of distribution [Vd\\/F]; elimination half-life [T(?)]; and elimination rate constant [Kel]) in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs enabled the prediction of human parameter values for des-ciclesonide using the well-accepted tool of allometry after intravenous administration of ciclesonide. However, as a result of the rapid conversion of ciclesonide, it was possible to perform allometry for the CL parameter only. Simple allometry (CL = 4.781W?·????; R? = 0.9968) appeared to predict the CL of ciclesonide in close proximity of the observed value (observed: 101.25 L\\/h versus predicted: 135.62 L\\/h). In a similar manner, simple allometry predicted the human pharmacokinetic parameters of des-ciclesonide (CL\\/F, Vd\\/F, T(?), and Kel) within a two- to threefold range of the observed values. The allometric equations for des-ciclesonide parameter values were: CL\\/F = 4.8166W?·??? (R? = 0.8598); Vd\\/F = 19.052W?·??? (R? = 0.9049); T(?) = 3.7598W??·????(R? = 0.8551); and Kel = 0.1832W?·???? (R? = 0.8632). In conclusion, the data suggested that allometry tool may be amenable for the prediction of the pharmacokinetic parameters of des-ciclesonide despite differences in the conversion rates and bioavailability of the active metabolite in various animal species.']

In addition, the elderly who classified their speech as not good were those who presented with fewer teeth.', 'Most subjects presented one to 19 teeth and this fact was directly associated, among others factors, to the unsatisfactory perception that they reported in relation to their speech and to the too long period without visiting the dentist.']
['Effects of topical administration of nimodipine on cerebral blood flow following subarachnoid hemorrhage in pigs.', 'We sought to explore whether topical administration of nimodipine improves the abnormal cerebral perfusion following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in pigs. Fourteen pigs were randomly divided into three groups: sham (n=4), SAH (n=5), or SAH + nimodipine (n=5). The SAH model was established by injecting fresh autologous nonheparinized arterial blood into the suprasellae cistern. Nimodipine or saline placebo (0.04?g\\/mL) were administered to the operative area on the fourth day after the SAH model was established. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured 60?min after topical administration of nimodipine by cranial SPECT\\/CT scans with 5?mCi 99mTc-ECD injected intravenously. The CCR (corticocebellar ratio) was calculated by dividing the counts\\/voxel of the whole cerebral hemisphere by the average count\\/voxel in the cerebellar region of reference and RD (relative dispersion). A predictor for impaired autoregulation of CBF was calculated by dividing standard deviation (SD) of regional perfusion by mean perfusion (RD=SD\\/Mean). CCR and RD were applied to describe hemisphere CBF and perfusion heterogeneity. Cerebral perfusion significantly decreased in the SAH group (CCR: 1.382±0.192, RD: 0.417±0.015) compared to sham (CCR: 1.988±0.346, RD 0.389±0.015) (p<0.05). Abnormal cerebral perfusion status, however, was not significantly improved in the nimodipine + SAH group (CCR: 1.503±0.107, RD: 0.425±0.018) compared to the SAH group (p>0.05). Topical administration of nimodipine did not significantly improve CBF following SAH. These findings were not consistent with our previous data demonstrating that the topical administration of nimodipine significantly alleviates cerebral vasospasm following SAH detected by TCD. Potential mechanisms governing these disparate outcomes require further investigation.']

['Effects of FX06 in vitro on platelet, coagulation, and fibrinolytic biomarkers in volunteers and patients with documented coronary artery disease.', 'FX06 is a naturally occurring fibrin-derived peptide demonstrated to confer cytoprotection in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Because the effect of FX06 on human platelet, coagulation, and fibrinolysis biomarkers (PCFB) is unknown but is important for further clinical development, we evaluated how FX06 affects PCFB. The in vitro effects of the whole-blood pre-incubation with escalating concentrations of FX06 (4, 25, and 75 μg\\/mL) were assessed in aspirin-na?ve healthy volunteers (n = 10), those with multiple risk factors for vascular disease (n = 10), and patients with documented coronary artery disease (n = 10). The last two groups were treated with aspirin (81 mg\\/daily). Thirty-two variables of PCFB were measured with the vehicle and for each chosen FX06 dose. Pretreatment of blood samples with FX06 resulted in a moderate but significant and mostly dose-dependent increases of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and collagen. Similarly, the closure time was reduced, suggesting share-induced activation, PECAM-1, GP Ib, GP IIb\\/IIIa activity, and vitronectin receptors, which were also up-regulated. In contrast, P-selectin and GPIIb antigen expression were reduced after FX06. All other PCFB were predominantly unaffected by FX06, with the exception of the increased plasminogen, decreased protein C activity, and activated von Willebrand factor. We conclude that in the therapeutic range, FX06 in vitro mildly affects hemostasis by way of mostly activating platelets. Applying moderate concomitant antiplatelet strategies should be considered for the adequate protection from vascular thrombotic events in patients treated with FX06. Similar ex vivo study in patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel is warranted.']

Results from this work show that the aggregates are vesicles and unstable; herein, we discuss the driving force behind the self-assembly. Apart from the van der Waals forces and repulsive electrostatic interactions between adjacent cation clusters, the hydrogen-bonding forces as well as counterion effects might also contribute to this driving force. The information obtained here is useful for a better understanding of the vital role that aggregation behavior plays in the field of ionic liquid recovery, and its potential use in controlled release, drug delivery, and petroleum recovery.']

Her screening mammography showed abnormal findings, and thus she consulted a hospital. A physical examination showed her mammary glands to be hard on both sides and no palpable mass was observed. Mammography revealed an amorphous calcification in the middle outer portion of the left breast. Ultrasonography showed an irregular hypoechoic mass measuring about 11 mm in size in the upper outer portion of the left breast. Although a core-needle biopsy specimen of the hypoechoic mass showed hyalinizing fibrosis without any evidence of malignancy, a stereotactic guided vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed because magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhanced area in the region of the amorphous calcification that could not be distinguished from breast cancer. The histological findings indicated noninvasive ductal carcinoma, and therefore a quardrantectomy with a sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma (0.7 × 0.3 cm) with a predominant intraductal component accompanying diabetic mastopathy. The sentinel lymph nodes demonstrated no metastasis. The surgical margin was positive for carcinoma and the patient later underwent a mastectomy. No malignant cells were observed in the specimen. The patient has so far experienced no recurrence after surgery.']
['Primary prevention of cardiovascular complications in type II diabetes patients using aspirin: a complicated tale.', 'Diabetes is a disease that affects 23 million in the United States alone. Within the past 20 years, there has been remarkable research performed concerning primary prevention of cardiovascular events in type II diabetes patients. The American Diabetes Association along with a government panel made recommendations that diabetes patients at a high risk of cardiovascular events should be on a low-dose aspirin regimen. However, more recent data show that aspirin has no clinical benefit to the diabetic patient as compared with a control group. Looking at research performed by groups in Japan, the United States, namely, the Primary Prevention Project, and a group in Ireland, we learn that there is no significant difference between diabetes patients who take aspirin and those who do not with respect to cardiovascular events. These studies are criticized by some newer research, and the prevailing thought about them call into question the results they obtained.Furthermore, we learn that many type II diabetes patients are not properly participating in an aspirin regimen or they are overusing aspirin, and these variables appear to confound the situation. One study showed that up to 50% of diabetes patients do not have their diabetes under control and are therefore increasing their risk for a multitude of complications arising from diabetes, including cardiovascular events.Finally, we learn of an upcoming project studying aspirin from Bayer, Inc. Much of the information presented in this article demonstrates the need for more and better research revolving around primary prevention of cardiovascular events in type II diabetes patients using aspirin.']

['Evolution of models to support community and policy action with science: Balancing pastoral livelihoods and wildlife conservation in savannas of East Africa.', 'We developed a "continual engagement" model to better integrate knowledge from policy makers, communities, and researchers with the goal of promoting more effective action to balance poverty alleviation and wildlife conservation in 4 pastoral ecosystems of East Africa. The model involved the creation of a core boundary-spanning team, including community facilitators, a policy facilitator, and transdisciplinary researchers, responsible for linking with a wide range of actors from local to global scales. Collaborative researcher-facilitator community teams integrated local and scientific knowledge to help communities and policy makers improve herd quality and health, expand biodiversity payment schemes, develop land-use plans, and fully engage together in pastoral and wildlife policy development. This model focused on the creation of hybrid scientific-local knowledge highly relevant to community and policy maker needs. The facilitation team learned to be more effective by focusing on noncontroversial livelihood issues before addressing more difficult wildlife issues, using strategic and periodic engagement with most partners instead of continual engagement, and reducing costs by providing new scientific information only when deemed essential. We conclude by examining the role of facilitation in redressing asymmetries in power in researcher-community-policy maker teams, the role of individual values and character in establishing trust, and how to sustain knowledge-action links when project funding ends.']
['Knowledge and innovation relationships in the shrimp industry in Thailand and Mexico.', 'Experts, government officials, and industry leaders concerned about the sustainability of shrimp aquaculture believe they know what farmers need to know and should be doing. They have framed sustainability as a technical problem that, at the farm level, is to be solved by better shrimp and management of ponds and businesses. Codes of conduct, standards, and regulations are expected to bring deviant practices into line. Shrimp farmers are often cornered in a challenging game of knowledge in which their livelihoods are at stake. In the commodity chain there are multiple relations with both suppliers and buyers, not all of which are trustworthy. The social networks shrimp farmers belong to are crucial for sifting out misinformation and multiplying insights from personal experience in learning by doing. Successful farmers become part of a learning culture through seminars, workshops, and clubs in which knowledge and practices are continually re-evaluated. The combination of vertical and horizontal relationships creates a set of alternative arenas that together are critical to bridging knowledge and action gaps for shrimp farmers. Government and industry initiatives for improving links between knowledge and practice for sustainability have largely succeeded when incentives are aligned: shrimp grow better in healthy environments, and using fewer resources means higher profits.']
['Treatment of elastase-induced intracranial aneurysms in New Zealand white rabbits by use of a novel neurovascular embolization stent device.', 'This study aims to test a novel balloon expandable stent covered with a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (neurovascular embolization cover (NEC), NFocus Neuromedical, Palo Alto, California) regarding angiographic and histologic aneurysm occlusion. Radiopacity, stent placement, navigation, flexibility, and intimal proliferation were also evaluated.', 'Eight aneurysms were induced in New Zealand white rabbits. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed directly after stent placement and after 5 and 10?min. Four and 8?weeks after stent placement, an intra-arterial DSA control was performed. The animals were then sacrificed and the aneurysms histologically evaluated.', 'The radiopaque markers were clearly visible. Although all the stents were easily navigated into the subclavian artery, the limited flexibility of the stent resulted in straightening of the vessel in four cases. As a result, exact stent placement was achieved and acutely confirmed in only two cases. However, at sacrifice, angiographic and histologic occlusion was noted at follow-up in five aneurysms.', 'In tortuous anatomy, the relative stiffness of the stent makes exact stent placement challenging. This may have been exacerbated by the movement of the vessels due to proximity to the heart in this model. Future studies should evaluate whether existing residual flow into an aneurysm lumen might lead to embolization without any additional treatment. Anticoagulation remains a very important part of aneurysm treatment with stents.

['Axillary and intramammary lymphadenopathy caused by Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease mimicking malignant lymphoma.', 'We describe a rare case of intramammary and axillary lymphadenopathy caused by Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). A 30-year-old woman presented with enlarged axillary lymph nodes and a right breast mass with tenderness. Computed tomography, ultrasonography, F-2-deoxy-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography and fine-needle aspiration cytology were performed, and malignant lymphoma (ML) was suspected. Histological diagnosis of a needle biopsy and surgical specimen showed histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. It is important to differentiate KFD from ML because of differences in treatment choice and clinical outcome.']
['Continuous positive airway pressure treatment in addition to optimal medical therapy for ventricular ectopy in a patient with heart failure and sleep-related breathing disorder.', 'In this report we describe the case of a 56-year-old man with a medical history of onset of asthenia, palpitations and dyspnoea for mild efforts. After a negative ergometric test for myocardial ischaemia and 24-h Holter monitoring showing frequent ventricular premature beats, but an echocardiogram with significant dilation and dysfunction of the left ventricle, coronary angiography was performed and did not show haemodynamically significant stenosis. Regarding the anamnesis of snoring, daytime sleepiness and the relationship between sleep-related breathing disorder and cardiovascular disease, we performed a cardiorespiratory sleep study that indicated a diagnosis of sleep-related breathing disorder with prevalent obstructive apnoea. In addition to optimal medical therapy for cardiovascular disease, the patient began therapy with continuous positive airway pressure during the night. This showed a considerable decrease in ventricular premature beats (VPBs) during the night, a better control of ventricular ectopy during the day and a better compliance with medical therapy.']
['A late presentation of Dandy-Walker malformation and aortic coarctation.', 'The Dandy-Walker malformation is a rare anomaly of the posterior cranial fossa. Concomitant brain or systemic malformations are frequent and can influence the outcome. Associated cardiac congenital defects usually induce a poor prognosis. We report a case of a 58-yearold man with hydrocephalus, in whom Dandy-Walker malformation was diagnosed, for the first time, after the demonstration of aortic coarctation. This association is very rare and only a few cases have been described; moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first description of this incidence in a middle-aged patient. The characteristic of diseases and physiopathologic features are discussed, focusing attention on the rare and late clinical manifestations.']

['Biological cluster evaluation for gene function prediction.', 'Recent advances in high-throughput omics techniques render it possible to decode the function of genes by using the "guilt-by-association" principle on biologically meaningful clusters of gene expression data. However, the existing frameworks for biological evaluation of gene clusters are hindered by two bottleneck issues: (1) the choice for the number of clusters, and (2) the external measures which do not take in consideration the structure of the analyzed data and the ontology of the existing biological knowledge. Here, we address the identified bottlenecks by developing a novel framework that allows not only for biological evaluation of gene expression clusters based on existing structured knowledge, but also for prediction of putative gene functions. The proposed framework facilitates propagation of statistical significance at each of the following steps: (1) estimating the number of clusters, (2) evaluating the clusters in terms of novel external structural measures, (3) selecting an optimal clustering algorithm, and (4) predicting gene functions. The framework also includes a method for evaluation of gene clusters based on the structure of the employed ontology. Moreover, our method for obtaining a probabilistic range for the number of clusters is demonstrated valid on synthetic data and available gene expression profiles from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally, we propose a network-based approach for gene function prediction which relies on the clustering of optimal score and the employed ontology. Our approach effectively predicts gene function on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae data set and is also employed to obtain putative gene functions for an Arabidopsis thaliana data set.']
['A case of tumor-forming pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia of the breast.', 'Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), characterized by the presence of slit-like spaces embedded in a hyalinized stroma, is sometimes observed during pathologic examination of breast-tissue specimens. Because tumor-forming PASH is rare, we report a case of a 41-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with a tumor in her left breast. Ultrasonography and aspiration biopsy cytology revealed a benign tumor. After performing Mammotome(?) biopsy, the lesion was diagnosed as PASH of the breast based on characteristic findings of histology and immunohistochemical studies. Because PASH tumors do not usually become malignant, we decided to perform ultrasonographic follow-up without tumor excision.']
['Linking knowledge with action in the pursuit of sustainable water-resources management.', 'Managing water for sustainable use and economic development is both a technical and a governance challenge in which knowledge production and sharing play a central role. This article evaluates and compares the role of participatory governance and scientific information in decision-making in four basins in Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, and the United States. Water management institutions in each of the basins have evolved during the last 10-20 years from a relatively centralized water-management structure at the state or national level to a decision structure that involves engaging water users within the basins and the development of participatory processes. This change is consistent with global trends in which states increasingly are expected to gain public acceptance for larger water projects and policy changes. In each case, expanded citizen engagement in identifying options and in decision-making processes has resulted in more complexity but also has expanded the culture of integrated learning. International funding for water infrastructure has been linked to requirements for participatory management processes, but, ironically, this study finds that participatory processes appear to work better in the context of decisions that are short-term and easily adjusted, such as water-allocation decisions, and do not work so well for longer-term, high-stakes decisions regarding infrastructure. A second important observation is that the costs of capacity building to allow meaningful stakeholder engagement in water-management decision processes are not widely recognized. Failure to appreciate the associated costs and complexities may contribute to the lack of successful engagement of citizens in decisions regarding infrastructure.']
['Early distant relapse in early stage triple-negative breast cancer: usefulness of FDG-PET for diagnosis of distant metastases.', 'Triple-negative breast cancer is extremely aggressive and more likely to metastasize than other subtypes of breast cancer. Better understanding of the distinct patterns of relapse and early detection will help identify patients who need aggressive treatment. Here we report a case of early stage triple-negative breast cancer with no lymph node metastasis at the time of breast-conserving surgery in a 46-year-old woman. She developed distant metastases immediately after completing adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery, which were detected by an [18F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan. Although routine use of FDG-PET is not recommended for early stage breast cancer, FDG-PET might be useful for the early detection of distant metastasis among patients with triple-negative breast cancer.']

['Can mammographic assessments lead to consider density as a risk factor for breast cancer?', 'Admitting that mammographic breast density is an important independent risk factor for breast cancer in the general population, has a crucial economical health care impact, since it might lead to increasing screening frequency or reinforcing additional modalities. Thus, the impact of density as a risk factor has to be carefully investigated and might be debated. Some authors suggested that high density would be either a weak factor or confused with a masking effect. Others concluded that most of the studies have methodological biases in basic physics to quantify percentage of breast density, as well as in mammographic acquisition parameters. The purpose of this review is to evaluate mammographic procedures and density assessments in published studies regarding density as a breast cancer risk. No standardization was found in breast density assessments and compared density categories. High density definitions varied widely from 25 to 75% of dense tissues on mammograms. Some studies showed an insufficient follow-up to reveal masking effect related to mammographic false negatives. Evaluating breast density impact needs thorough studies with consensual mammographic procedures, methods of density measurement, breast density classification as well as a standardized definition of high breast density. Digital mammography, more effective in dense breasts, should help to re-evaluate the issue of density as a risk factor for breast cancer.']
['Making short-term climate forecasts useful: Linking science and action.', 'This paper discusses the evolution of scientific and social understanding that has led to the development of knowledge systems supporting the application of El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts, including the development of successful efforts to connect climate predictions with sectoral applications and actions "on the ground". The evolution of "boundary-spanning" activities to connect science and decisionmaking is then discussed, setting the stage for a report of outcomes from an international workshop comprised of producers, translators, and users of climate predictions. The workshop, which focused on identifying critical boundary-spanning features of successful boundary organizations, included participants from Australia, Hawaii, and the Pacific Islands, the US Pacific Northwest, and the state of Ceará in northwestern Brazil. Workshop participants agreed that boundary organizations have multiple roles including those of information broker, convenor of forums for engagement, translator of scientific information, arbiter of access to knowledge, and exemplar of adaptive behavior. Through these roles, boundary organizations will ensure the stability of the knowledge system in a changing political, economic, and climatic context. The international examples reviewed in this workshop demonstrated an interesting case of convergent evolution, where organizations that were very different in origin evolved toward similar structures and individuals engaged in them had similar experiences to share. These examples provide evidence that boundary organizations and boundary-spanners fill some social\\/institutional roles that are independent of culture.']
['Pheochromocytoma presenting as inverted Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a case report and review of the literature.', 'The classical entity of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is well established in the literature, but mechanisms explaining it remain unelucidated. Recently, the uncommon inverted Takotsubo type (sparing apical ballooning) has been more frequently described. We report the case of a 26-year-old man admitted with gastrointestinal symptoms, whose clinical presentation for a stress-related cardiomyopathy, which usually presents with cardiopulmonary symptoms, was rather atypical. The cardiac assessment including echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas coronary angiography showed the absence of atherosclerotic disease. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left adrenal mass, and elevated urinary catecholamine levels were highly suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Prompt medical and surgical treatments were instituted. During the left adrenalectomy the patient suffered from brief electromechanical dissociation requiring aggressive resuscitation. Postoperative course was unremarkable. Reverse Takotsubo heart failure is a recently recognized syndrome and a systematic review of the literature of 10 cases of pheochromocytoma-induced inverted Takotsubo is presented in the present article.']
['The role of innovative global institutions in linking knowledge and action.', "It is becoming increasingly recognized that our collective ability to tackle complex problems will require the development of new, adaptive, and innovative institutional arrangements that can deal with rapidly changing knowledge and have effective learning capabilities. In this paper, we applied a knowledge-systems perspective to examine how institutional innovations can affect the generation, sharing, and application of scientific and technical knowledge. We report on a case study that examined the effects that one large innovative organization, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, is having on the knowledge dimensions of decision-making in global health. The case study shows that the organization created demand for new knowledge from a range of actors, but it did not incorporate strategies for meeting this demand into their own rules, incentives, or procedures. This made it difficult for some applicants to meet the organization's dual aims of scientific soundness and national ownership of projects. It also highlighted that scientific knowledge needed to be integrated with managerial and situational knowledge for success. More generally, the study illustrates that institutional change targeting implementation can also significantly affect the dynamics of knowledge creation (learning), access, distribution, and use. Recognizing how action-oriented institutions can affect these dynamics across their knowledge system can help institutional designers build more efficient and effective institutions for sustainable development."]
['FGF-2-responsive and spinal cord-resident cells improve locomotor function after spinal cord injury.', 'The adult central nervous system has only a limited capacity for axonal regeneration. In this study, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was injected once into the spinal cord tissue around the injury site immediately after complete spinal cord transection in rats. This treatment markedly improved the locomotor function of the animals. Histological analysis demonstrated that tissue composed of FGF-2-induced fibronectin-positive cells (FIFs) had infiltrated the injury site and filled large cystic cavities, into which numerous axons with growth-associated protein-43 immunoreactivity penetrated. The FIFs could also be cultured from the intact spinal cord tissue, demonstrating that they were resident in the non-injured spinal cord. They had a spindle-shaped morphology and enhanced expression of mRNAs of N-cadherin and neurotrophic factors, suggesting the beneficial properties of the FIFs for axonal regeneration. Thus, these results argue for the continual use of autologous transplantation as a novel and promising cell therapy for the treatment of spinal cord injury.']
['Influenza H1N1 infection in a patient with psoriatic arthritis in treatment with Adalimumab: a case report.', 'In March 2009 was the beginning of an epidemic flue caused by avian influenza A virus H1N1. The disease varies from mild to serious and fatal cases. There are many hypotheses explaining why this virus infection would be fatal. One of these is the impaired immune response of the infected patient. The use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors may cause decreased immune response and greater susceptibility to infections. We presented a case of a patient using adalimumab that have developed H1N1 without complications. This is the first case of H1N1 in a patient using adalimumab reported in Brazil. We discuss the possibility that anti-TNF may not predisposes to a serious form of the disease or fatal complications.']
['Listeria monocytogenes infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.', 'Listeria monocytogenes infection (LMI) is a rare complication in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and it is associated with nonspecific clinical manifestations and is often mistaken with SLE flares. Several cases of LMI in SLE patients have been reported, with high mortality rates. This article describes five new cases of LMI in patient with SLE in a cohort of 174 patients (2.8%). All patients were women, with a mean age of 19.4 years (range, 5-29 years). Mean duration of SLE before clinical LMI was 2.8 years (range, 2-4 years). Recurrent infection was not evidenced. At the time of LMI, all patients had an inactive disease, receiving steroids and immunosuppressive treatment. Clinical picture of meningitis was present in two patients. All patients were treated with ampicillin, with resolution of clinical manifestations without sequels. In order to eliminate the intracellular forms of L. monocytogenes, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated, and an allergic skin reaction was presented in all but one patient. Our report highlights the unspecific clinical manifestations of LMI and these characteristics are initially challenging and may be interpreted as lupus flares. An accurate diagnosis and an early antibiotic treatment are essential to improve the outcome in these patients.']
['Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia type III with leukocytoclastic vasculitis: remission by rituximab.', 'We report about a 39-year-old female patient with severe essential mixed cryoglobulinemia of type III with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient was admitted into our hospital with mesenteric lymphangiitis, which caused enteral perforation, sepsis, and pneumonia. Cryoglobulins, cryocrit, Ig-titers, and biopsy were positive for mixed cryoglobulinemia type III. We detected no signs of hepatitis C, B, or any other infectious disease. At first, disease activity could be kept under control with high doses of glucocorticoids and multiple cyclophosphamide pulses. However, after therapy with three pulses of rituximab, steroids were stopped, and the patient has not presented any symptoms for 2 years. Therefore, we suggest that rituximab affected her disease rapidly and effectively. In conclusion, rituximab is an alternative therapy for mixed cryoglobulinemia of type III with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.']
['Genomics education training needs of U.S. health educators: a (qualitative) pilot study.', "As genomic advances have turned the promise of personalized prevention and health promotion into a concrete possibility in the near future, scholars and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have begun to call for U.S. health educators to develop their genomic competencies. This advocacy, however, begs the question whether health educators feel the need for further genomic training. Using an emergent design, the authors analyze qualitative data obtained from in-depth interviews with 24 health educators in the United States. Data are searched for salient, emergent themes (salience is determined by the frequency of a theme's occurrence across interviews). Findings indicate that although the majority (78.3%) of health educators have received minimal or no genomic education, 81.0% acknowledge the importance of adding some type of training to their future professional development. Participants suggest conference presentations, workshops, and symposia (54.5%) as the most preferable approach for delivering such training. The four most frequently desired training topics include applied genetics\\/genomics (85.7%), basic genetics\\/genomics (42.9%), current and future developments in genetics\\/genomics (28.6%), and genetic testing and screening (19.0%). Findings from this qualitative study can become catalysts for future examinations of this topic and provide the conceptual basis for developing genomics training materials specifically for health educators."]

['Approaches to advancing quantitative human health risk assessment of environmental chemicals in the post-genomic era.', 'The contribution of genomics and associated technologies to human health risk assessment for environmental chemicals has focused largely on elucidating mechanisms of toxicity, as discussed in other articles in this issue. However, there is interest in moving beyond hazard characterization to making more direct impacts on quantitative risk assessment (QRA)--i.e., the determination of toxicity values for setting exposure standards and cleanup values. We propose that the evolution of QRA of environmental chemicals in the post-genomic era will involve three, somewhat overlapping phases in which different types of approaches begin to mature. The initial focus (in Phase I) has been and continues to be on "augmentation" of weight of evidence--using genomic and related technologies qualitatively to increase the confidence in and scientific basis of the results of QRA. Efforts aimed towards "integration" of these data with traditional animal-based approaches, in particular quantitative predictors, or surrogates, for the in vivo toxicity data to which they have been anchored are just beginning to be explored now (in Phase II). In parallel, there is a recognized need for "expansion" of the use of established biomarkers of susceptibility or risk of human diseases and disorders for QRA, particularly for addressing the issues of cumulative assessment and population risk. Ultimately (in Phase III), substantial further advances could be realized by the development of novel molecular and pathway-based biomarkers and statistical and in silico models that build on anticipated progress in understanding the pathways of human diseases and disorders. Such efforts would facilitate a gradual "reorientation" of QRA towards approaches that more directly link environmental exposures to human outcomes.']
['Hormonal therapy in a patient with ovarian agenesis and possible SLE: a choice to be made.', 'Systemic lupus erythromatosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, which affects mainly women in the reproductive age and is influenced by hormonal changes. Therefore, hormone supplementation for patients with SLE either as contraceptives or as postmenopausal supplementation remains a controversial issue. Herein, we report a case of a 22-year-old woman with a history of ovarian agenesis, treated for several years with hormone therapy in order to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and other estrogen-deficient disorders. At the current evaluation, she met 3 of 11 diagnostic criteria for SLE along with a strong familial autoimmune predisposition. Precipitation of SLE in patients treated with hormonal therapy has been previously described. This prompted us to seek alternative drug therapies that prevent both the onset of overt SLE as well as the progression of estrogen-deficient phenomena. This unique case illustrates the dilemma of using hormone therapy in patients at risk to develop SLE and the current therapeutic alternatives.']

Clinically, Kimura's disease is characterized by subcutaneous nodular lesions, usually localised in head and neck, often associated with regional lymphadenopathy. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE are often observed. We report a case of a 40-year-old Italian patient presenting with nodular subcutaneous lesions and peripheral eosinophilia. Based on clinical, histopathological and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of Kimura's disease was made. The patient was treated with very low doses of cyclosporine A with no evidence of disease recurrence over the following 8 years. However, the discontinuation of cyclosporine A determined a relapse of the disease. The relevance of this case is due to the rarity of the disease in Italy, to its peculiar clinical presentation and, moreover, it is the first case in literature that has a good response to treatment with low doses of cyclosporine A, documented in an 8-year follow-up."]

['Early detection of testicular cancer: revisiting the role of self-efficacy in testicular self-examination among young asymptomatic males.', "Research suggests that self-efficacy is an important factor in behaviors that facilitate the early-detection of various cancers. In general people with high self-efficacy are more likely to attend cancer screening sessions or perform bodily self-exams. However, there is a paucity of research focusing on testicular cancer and testicular self-examination (TSE). The effect of self-efficacy on TSE remains unclear especially given the relative obscurity of the testicular cancer threat, and appropriate clinical- and self-detection procedures, in the young asymptomatic male population. Thus, the present study tested the interaction of self-efficacy with young men's appraisals of the threat of testicular cancer. The study was based on 2 × 2 × 2 mixed factorial experimental design. Over 100 young asymptomatic men were exposed to a health warning about testicular cancer and randomly assigned to high\\/low self-efficacy, vulnerability, and severity conditions. High self-efficacy increased motivation to perform TSE given high vulnerability, but damaged attitudes to self-exams given low vulnerability and severity estimates. High self-efficacy also facilitated subsequent TSE. Overall, these findings support preexisting notions of self-efficacy but raise new questions about the moderating effects of threat appraisals."]

['An Adaptive Run Length Encoding method for the compression of electrocardiograms.', 'A compression method, based on the choice of a wavelet that minimizes the distortion of compression for each electrocardiogram considered, is proposed in this paper. The scaling filter used on the determination of the wavelet function is obtained from the resolution of an optimization problem, which is unconstrained since the scaling filter is parametrized in a way that the constraints applied to the scaling filter are embedded on the parameters. The coefficients of projection of the signal over the wavelet subspaces are calculated and only the most significant ones are retained, being the significant coefficients determined in order to satisfy a pre-specified distortion measure. The bitmap that informs the positions of the retained coefficients is encoded along with the values of the coefficients by using an improved version of the Run Length Encoding technique. Experiments that compare the proposed approach with other techniques illustrate the efficiency of the method.']

Persistent oxygen desaturations and copious salivation led to further investigations, and a delayed diagnosis of oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula was made. Radiological demonstration of an NG tube reaching the stomach does not exclude the diagnosis of oesophageal atresia and can be falsely reassuring and lead to diagnostic delay.']
['Revision and psychometric properties of the caring assessment tool.', 'Evaluation of the Caring Assessment Tool (CAT) is essential for its use in the monitoring and ongoing improvement of patient-nurse relationships. This descriptive, prospective study evaluated the dimensionality and internal reliability of the instrument in a sample of hospitalized adults. In addition, reduction of items was achieved, lessening clinical and administrative burden. Data were collected from 1,111 patients in 12 U.S. hospitals in 4 geographically distinct regions. A single factor explained 73% of the variance in the construct and the number of items was reduced to 27. Internal consistency remained high (a = .97). Patient-nurse relationship data were collected safely and efficiently from hospitalized patients using a paper-and-pencil approach. The CAT holds promise for providing acute care registered nurses with the information they need to deliver reliable patient-centered care.']
['Phyllodes tumor showing intraductal growth.', 'Phyllodes tumor of the breast is a rare fibroepithelial lesion and particularly uncommon in adolescent girls. It is thought to arise from the periductal rather than intralobular stroma. Usually, it is seen as a well-defined mass. Phyllodes tumor showing intraductal growth is extremely rare. Here we report a girl who has a phyllodes tumor with intraductal growth.']
['Morphometric Analysis of Vertebral Growth Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Normal Skeletally Immature Spine.', 'Morphometic analysis of the thoracic and lumbar pedicle, vertebral body, and spinal canal in the normal infantile and juvenile patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).', 'To 3-dimensionally characterize the growth of the vertebral column in vivo and define the accurate dynamic growth rate of the normal immature spine.', 'There is a relationship between growth of the spine and the development of spinal deformity. Currently available information regarding vertebral column growth is remarkably limited and poorly defined. The detailed morphologic research is needed to obtain accurate data with regard to growth of the vertebra, including coronal, sagittal, and axial growth information for normal states.', 'A total of 34 pediatric patients with a normal straight spine who had MRI from thoracic vertebra 1 to lumbar vertebra 5 were assigned to 3 groups: infantile group (n?=?11), 0 to 3 years of age; juvenile-young group (n?=?16), 4 to 7 years of age; and juvenile-old group (n?=?7), 8 to 10 years of age. True transverse and midsagittal MRI images were used for pedicle (width and length), vertebral body (height, depth and width), and spinal canal area measurements.', 'The mean increase of the pedicle width and length was 0.7?mm (16%) and 3.2?mm (18%) from the infantile to the juvenile-young, and was 0.9?mm (15%) and 2.2?mm (11%) through the juvenile-old group. The mean increase of the vertebra body width, depth, and height were 3.6?mm (15%), 4.5?mm (27%), and 3.1?mm (27%), respectively, from the infantile to the juvenile-young, and were 2.9?mm (10%), 1.9?mm (9%) and 2.1?mm (15%), respectively, through the juvenile-old group. The mean increase of the spinal canal area was 41 mm (19%) from the infantile to the juvenile-young and was only 1.8 mm (0.7%) through the juvenile-old group.', 'The current study established the growth of the pedicle, spinal canal, and vertebral body in vivo in a sample of normal pediatric subjects. The vertebral growth rate in the infantile and the juvenile-young period was significantly greater than that in the juvenile-old period. Spinal canal growth is associated with the growth of the pedicle width and has little growth after the juvenile-young period. Pedicle screw fixation would be unlikely to influence the size of the spinal canal after the early juvenile period, but may disturb the pedicle growth in length.']
['Effect of sulfonylurea dose escalation on hemoglobin A1c in Veterans Affairs patients with type 2 diabetes.', 'Sulfonylureas are often titrated to maximum doses despite evidence that their efficacy plateaus above half-maximum doses. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of doubling the dose of glyburide and glipizide to high doses on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in Veterans Affairs patients with type 2 diabetes. A retrospective review of 131 patient cases with prescriptions for high-dose glyburide or glipizide from July 1 through December 18, 2008, was conducted. Three dosage groups were examined: glyburide 5?mg twice daily increased to 10?mg twice daily (GLYB), glipizide 5?mg twice daily increased to 10?mg twice daily (GLIPA), and glipizide 10?mg twice daily increased to 20?mg twice daily (GLIPB). Each patient served as his or her own control; HbA1c after at least 75?days on each dose was compared. There was a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c in GLIPA only (mean?±?SD 8.0?±?1.0 vs. 7.6?±?1.0%, P?=?0.03). No significant change in HbA1c was detected in GLYB (8.1?±?1.1 vs. 8.1?±?1.3%, P?=?0.80) and the evaluation of GLIPB (8.6?±?1.7 vs. 8.2?±?1.1%, P?=?0.41) was not adequately powered due to the small sample size. In this small retrospective study, increasing glipizide, but not glyburide, from 5?mg to 10?mg twice daily significantly decreased HbA1c in patients with diabetes.']
['Novel 2-hydrazino-pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives with pseudofunctional- similarity to siderophores as potential antimycobacterial agents.', 'Siderophores are small molecules produced by bacteria under iron-scarcity conditions faced by bacteria inside host. Sideophores bind iron with high affinity (Kd < 10-25 M) and are required for iron transport into the bacterial cell. Small molecules interfering with siderophore functioning can be promising anti-mycobacterial agents. Several molecules with hydrazone as a structural feature are known to have metal chelating property. This prompted us to investigate the metal chelating ability of 2-hydrazino-pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives. In this light, a library of 22 novel molecules with 2- hydrazino-pyrimidin-4(3H)-one moiety was synthesized and the compounds were evaluated against M. tuberculosis under iron-limiting and iron-rich conditions. Interestingly, several molecules showed promising (MIC: < 10 μM) selective activity under iron scarcity conditions. Furthermore, compounds were found to be nontoxic at lower concentration in VERO cell lines using MTT assay. Taken together, we have discovered novel 2-hydrazino-pyrimidin-4(3H)-one molecules active against M. tuberculosis which can be developed as potent antimycobacterial agents.']
['A case of apoplectic lymphocytic hypophysitis complicated by polymyalgia rheumatica.', 'A case of apoplectic lymphocytic hypophysitis complicated by polymyalgia rheumatica (PMA) is described. A 72-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to severe headache. Two months prior to admission, the patients had exhibited recent-onset stiffness and myalgia of shoulder and pelvic girdle that was compatible with PMR. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass lesion in the pituitary fossa with focal hemorrhage. Endocrinologic studies demonstrated hypopituitarism. The headache and myalgia were improving with corticosteroid treatment; however, a trans-sphenoidal surgery was performed due to visual field loss. A white-colored mass was resected, and histologic examination showed diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells consistent with lymphocytic hypophysitis. Post-operatively, the headache and visual field loss resolved completely. This is the first documented case of apoplectic lymphocytic hypophysitis complicating PMR, and a possible mechanism for this rare association was discussed.']
['Anomalous "High Take-Off" of the right coronary artery evaluated by coronary CT angiography.', 'Congenital coronary anomalies are uncommon but can cause sudden cardiac death or myocardial ischemia. Conventional coronary angiography is an invasive and expensive modality, sometimes unable to delineate the exact origin and course of an anomalous artery. In this case report, we describe an "extremely rare" anomaly of the right coronary artery where a 64-slice multidetector computed tomography provided valuable information regarding its exact site of the aortocoronary take-off and its spatial relationship with the great vessels. Knowledge of CT appearances and an understanding of the clinical significance of these anomalies are essential for making the correct diagnosis and planning patient treatment.']

All participants underwent complete ocular and visual field examinations and OCT-3 imaging on the same day. A 3×3 mm area temporal to the foveal reflex was scanned with the OCT-3 using 6 horizontal, equally spaced raster lines. Retinal thickness was evaluated at points 500 μm apart for each line and S\\/I RT ratio computed between similar points above and below the fovea for each patient. One-way ANOVA was used to compare S\\/I RT ratio between the normal, early, and advanced glaucoma eyes.', 'Average retinal thickness increased progressively, as points temporal to the fovea were scanned. There was a statistically significant difference between the average superior and inferior retinal thickness at points 1500, 2000, and 2500 μm temporal to the fovea in both early and advanced glaucoma eyes (P<0.05) with corresponding significant differences in the S\\/I RT ratios, when compared with the normal participants (P<0.017).', 'OCT-3-generated S\\/I RT ratios were successfully able to reproduce the structural damage in eyes with early and advanced glaucoma field defects and can complement optic disc scanning protocols in diagnosing glaucoma at an early stage.']

['An unusual case of ANA negative systemic lupus erythematosus presented with vasculitis, long-standing serositis and full-house nephropathy.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that may affect any organ of the body. We report here an unusual case of seronegative SLE presented as vasculitis with rash, lower gastrointestinal system bleeding and acute renal failure. The patient was a 13-year-old boy, with abdominal distention, pretibial edema, arthritis and petechia on bilateral ankles. He had deteriorated renal functions (creatinine 1.65 mg\\/dl), hypoalbuminemia (1.6 g\\/dl) and hypocomplementemia with nephrotic range proteinuria and hematuria. He developed pleural effusion and peritonitis. Serum ANA, anti dsDNA, p ANCA, c ANCA, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG titers were negative. A renal biopsy was performed which revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with full-house staining pattern in immunofluorescent microscopic examination suggesting Class IV Lupus Nephritis. He was administered a total of six courses of monthly intravenous pulse methyl prednisolone, dipyridamole, oral cyclophosphamide followed by azothiopirine and oral prednisolone therapy. The renal functions and serum albumin levels turned normal but peritonitis persisted and disappeared after the third pulse steroid therapy. In conclusion, we presented this patient to remind the possibility of SLE in such seronegative patients with unusual findings in order to avoid the delay in the management of this disease with high mortality and morbidity if not treated. Full-house nephropathy is an important clue especially for the diagnosis of ANA negative SLE.']
["Laryngeal involvement in Behcet's disease--a challenge for treatment.", "A patient with severe Behcet's disease (BD) was referred to our clinic because of severe pharyngolaryngeal involvement. This complication developed under treatment of prednisone and etanercept (Enbrel) 25 mg twice a week. A surgical approach was considered, but following three daily doses of Solu-Medrol (500 mg each) and 300 mg infliximab on the fourth day, the patient improved significantly. This is the first case reporting treatment with infliximab in laryngeal involvement of BD. Although some cases may still require surgical intervention, the therapeutic option of anti-TNF agents, specifically anti-TNF antibodies such as infliximab, may decrease the need for the surgical option."]
['Alcohol use of diabetes patients: the need for assessment and intervention.', 'It is well known that diabetes self-care behaviors are critical to disease progression. Unfortunately, many patients do not adhere to diabetes self-care recommendations despite their importance. Alcohol use has been identified as a barrier to diabetes self-care adherence. Excessive alcohol consumption not only negatively impacts diabetes self-care adherence but also affects the course of diabetes. Diabetes patients who are at-risk drinkers are likely to have poor diabetes treatment adherence, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Alcohol consumption by diabetes patients is often inadequately assessed and addressed in their medical care. Brief interventions to reduce at-risk drinking have been well validated in a variety of patient populations and offer the potential to improve diabetes treatment adherence and outcome. Assessment and treatment of at-risk drinking could be readily incorporated into routine diabetes care. Strategies for brief assessment of and intervention for at-risk drinking are offered.']
['A novel TNFRSF1 gene mutation in a Turkish family: a report of three cases.', 'Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited rare autoinflammatory disease. It is caused by mutations in exons 2-3 and 4-5 of the tumor necrosing factor receptor superfamily 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene on chromosome 12p13.2. TNFRSF1A gene encodes the 55-kDa receptor for tumor necrosis factor. Attacks are associated with abdominal pain, myalgia, erythematous skin rash, conjunctivitis, and periorbital edema. Until now, more than 80 mutations have been identified. We herein report three patients with TRAPS of Turkish origin. The patients were followed up in our outpatient clinic in Kocaeli University Division of Rheumatology. Because of their TRAPS associated clinical features, we isolated genomic DNA from whole blood and sequenced the exon 2-3 and 4-5 third exon of TNFRSF1A gene after amplification with appropriate primers. One of the patients with TRAPS was 47-year-old female, who described recurrent attacks of fever, urticarial rash, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal pain, thoracic pain, headache, fatigue, and elevated acute phase response since her childhood. With the sequencing of the TNFRSF1A gene, we identified heterozygous C29R mutation, which has not been reported before in any TRAPS patient. The other patients are her sons with similar findings and age 29 and 26. They were heterozygous for C29R mutation in TNFRSF1A gene too. We report novel C29R mutation in three TRAPS patients of Turkish origin, in which the main clinical features are recurrent fever attacks, erythematous skin rash, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia. Treatment with steroids resolved the symptoms and lesions.']
['Minimal iliac bone harvesting in sinus lift surgery.', 'For sinus grafting, the authors propose a minimal posterior iliac bone harvesting, with local anesthesia. Autogenous bone grafting continues to be considered the gold standard for sinus grafting. The classic harvesting sites are calvarial, anterior iliac, and tibial, and harvesting is usually practiced under general anesthesia. We performed this technique in 7 patients under local anesthesia. In the posterior iliac crest, with a specific trocar for bone puncture biopsy, bone was harvested. We performed 1 cm longer for 5-mm diameter of bone. Three bone biopsies were harvested on each side. The harvested cancellous bone (5 cm(3)) was mixed with triphosphocalcic (TCP) material (2 cm(3)), and blood (1 cm(3)). A classic sinus lift was realized. After 6 months, the success rate of bone grafting was 100%. Each of the 7 patients could be implanted by an average of 4 dental implants by superior maxillary. For sinus lift, this simple posterior iliac-bone biopsy harvesting under local anesthesia is very comfortable for the patient and also safe. It provides enough marrow bone to be mixed with TCP for a sinus lift.']
['Buddy balloon for TAVI.', 'Percutaneous transfemoral aortic valve replacement is a new rapidly evolving technique that has made significant progress in recent years. The technology is however limitted and in some cases has resulted in failure to deliver the prosthetic valve. We describe a new technique using a buddy balloon, from the contralateral femoral artery, to assist in crossing the native aortic valve in those cases where extreme calcification and or tortuosity have caused the delivery system to hang up on the aortic wall. The technique is easily applied and facilitates the success of the procedure in cases which may otherwise have to be converted to open surgical aortic valve replacement.']
['Polyarteritis nodosa with multiple aneurysms and renal arteriovenous fistula successfully diagnosed by colour Doppler sonography.', 'Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a vasculitis that typically affects small- and middle-sized arteries of multiple organs. The kidney is most commonly involved. To date, few cases of PAN involving the celiac artery and no cases of iliac artery or internal carotid artery involvement have been published. The most frequent lesions reported were due to occlusions and aneurysms. Finally, no cases of PAN causing arteriovenous fistula have been reported. Here we present a case of PAN with multiple aneurysms and renal arteriovenous fistula that was successfully diagnosed and followed-up by ultrasound. This case report describes the challenges in diagnosing PAN and highlights the importance of a holistic approach when encountering patients with multiple vascular diseases. Ultrasound should be considered the first-line approach in the diagnosis of PAN.']
['Successful plasma exchange combined with rituximab therapy in aggressive APS-related cutaneous necrosis.', 'Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by venous and\\/or arterial thrombosis or recurrent fetal loss associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and\\/or a lupus anticoagulant. The skin appears to be an important target organ and many cases of APS may present with skin manifestations. These lesions may be manifold and may take the form of livedo reticularis, livedo racemosa, ulcerations, digital gangrene, subungeal splinter hemorrhages, superficial venous thrombosis, thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudovasculitic manifestations, extensive cutaneous necrosis, or primary anetoderma. We report a case of fulminant APS-related cutaneous necrosis. A 38-year-old Caucasian male with a past history of APS, multiple deep vein thrombi\\/pulmonary emboli, presented with necrotic lesions on his right upper and right lower extremities. Initially, baseline anticoagulation was increased without improvement. Subsequently, plasma exchange was initiated on a daily schedule. Furthermore, rituximab 1,000 mg IV was administered on days 1 and 15. After six consecutive daily sessions of plasma exchange, there was significant regression of the necrotic lesions. After a 22-day hospital stay, the patient was discharged to home on fondaparinux. The patient presented approximately 2 months later after missing follow-up appointments. At the time, his initial lesions looked remarkably improved.']
['Primary pure signet cell carcinoma of the breast: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the breast is a rare tumor that is classified into mucinous carcinoma and other tumors with abundant mucin as an independent subset and entity under the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the breast. Pure form SRCC is very rare. To date, only a few cases have been reported in the literature. A case of primary SRCC of the breast in a 48-year-old woman is presented in this report. Histologically, the majority of the neoplastic cells are characterized by large intracytoplasmic mucin, compressing the nuclei toward one pole of the cell. The patient underwent both mastectomy and axillary lymph node excision. Adjuvant chemotherapy and chest wall irradiation were performed, and the case was discharged and followed up in remission for 20?months. The primary breast tumor was confirmed by clinical, morphological, and immunohistochemical studies. Characteristic features and differential diagnosis of this tumor were discussed in the light of pertinent literature.']
['A sarcoidosis patient with hand involvement and large pulmonary lymph nodes: results of 1-year treatment with methotrexate.', 'Sarcoidosis infrequently involves the phalanges and the adjacent soft tissue.

['A typically atypical tenosynovitis.', 'A 68-year-old woman developed tenosynovitis of the right second digit without a history of injury or animal bites. Apart from high titer anti-nuclear antibodies, serological studies were unremarkable. Tuberculin test and interferon gamma release assay were both negative. Several immunosuppressive therapies led only to partial relief of symptoms. Of note, clinical symptoms worsened significantly after introduction of adalimumab therapy. Tenosynovectomy was performed revealing a granulomatous inflammatory process. Seven weeks later, Mycobacterium malmoense could be cultured from the surgical specimen. A four drug antibiotic regimen was started and immunosuppressive therapy discontinued resulting in complete clinical remission. Our case highlights non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) tenosynovitis as an important differential diagnosis of atypical arthritis. A negative tuberculin skin test as well as negative Ziehl-Neelsen stain does not argue against NTM infection. In fact, mycobacterial culture for extended periods remains the gold standard for diagnosis.']

['Functional load in oblique bicortical implants: parasinusal implants and palatine implants.', 'The history of intraosseous implantology, as a whole, begins with the introduction of the Formiggini screw. Single-piece implants were subsequently derived from titanium bars. The intrinsic function of the emerging stump was immediate loading. The great stability of the implant in the bone thus demanded was eventually achieved by means of the self-tapping screw and bicortical support. Oblique implants were subsequently adopted to make the best use of the bone available and to avoid zones at risk, such as the maxillary sinus and the inferior alveolar nerve. Angled stumps on osseointegrated 2-stage implants were also described in the literature. There has since been a switch from sunken to single-stage implants in view of the usefulness of immediate loading. Recent articles have illustrated the use of inclined, nonbicortical implants; these are still placed in the spongy bone.']
['Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: does size really matter?', 'Pyloric stenosis is a common infantile disorder typically occurring between 2 weeks and 8 weeks of age. Presentation outside this range and in premature infants is uncommon and often atypical. We present three cases, a pair of premature twins and a 5.5-month-old infant with pyloric stenosis. We highlight that despite their difference in size and weight, ultrasound examination remains a reliable diagnostic tool. However, pyloric measurements should be interpreted in combination with the other dynamic features on ultrasound.']
['A systematic review of interventions to support siblings of children with chronic illness or disability.', 'Chronic illness or disability in children can have a deleterious effect on the psychosocial health of well siblings. This systematic review synthesised evidence from studies evaluating sibling-oriented care aimed at improving behavioural and emotional outcomes in well siblings of children with chronic illness or disability.', 'Twenty electronic databases were searched. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality were performed by two independent reviewers.', 'Five controlled and nine uncontrolled studies were included. In higher-quality controlled trials, benefits of sibling-oriented care included reduced anxiety, improved mood and behavioural adjustment; however, these findings were not consistently demonstrated across studies. Study differences made it difficult to determine which sibling care features were most salient.', 'Study findings highlight the potential for enhancing emotional and behavioural outcomes in well siblings. Future evaluations need to clearly identify the intended purpose of the care (what improvements are intended) and which types of siblings are most likely to benefit. This approach may yield more consistent and clinically important results.']
['Combating apoptosis and multidrug resistant cancers by targeting lysosomes.', 'Acquired therapy resistance is one of the prime obstacles for successful cancer treatment. Partial resistance is often acquired already during an early face of tumor development when genetic changes causing defects in classical caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway provide transformed cells with a growth advantage by protecting them against various apoptosis inducing stimuli including transforming oncogenes themselves and host immune system. Apoptosis defective cells are further selected during tumor progression and finally by apoptosis inducing treatments. Another form of resistance, multidrug resistance, arises during cancer treatment when cancer cells with effective efflux of cytotoxic agents escape the therapy. Remarkably, induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization has recently emerged as an effective way to kill apoptosis resistant cancer cells and some lysosome targeting drugs can also re-sensitize multidrug resistant cells to classical chemotherapy. In this review, we highlight recent data on lysosomal cell death pathways and their implications for the future treatment of apoptosis defective and multidrug resistant aggressive tumors.']
['Molecular characterization of HAO3, the homologue of the Bm86 tick vaccine antigen, from the Iranian isolate of Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum.', 'Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum tick is widely distributed in many parts of Iran and while the commercial vaccines based on the application of midgut-derived recombinant Bm86 antigen are used for its control, limited information about the efficiency of this vaccination in Iran is available. Herein, with the final aim of evaluation of Bm86-based heterologous vaccination, as the primary step the Bm86 homologue of the H. a. anatolicum (Hao3) from an Iranian isolate was characterized and compared with the commercialized Bm86 and other Bm86 homologoue sequences available in GenBank. Our in silico predictions resulted in the identification of seven epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, one hydrophobic transmembrane region, one leader sequence and several glycosylation sites within the structure of both Hao3 and Bm86 proteins, which suggested the pattern of extracellular membrane-bound glycoproteins with the role of regulation in cell growth for both proteins. Moreover, while the nucleotide and amino acid sequences corresponding to Bm86 homologue showed a high level of conservation among the Iranian isolates (Hao3, Hao3-1 and Hao3-2, more than 99%), the Hao3 amino acid sequence had a homology of around 89%, 64% and 65% with that of Indian, Australian and Argentinean isolates, respectively. This indicated a considerable variation between commercial Bm86 antigen and H. a. anatolicum Bm86-like protein of Iranian and Indian isolates. Taking together, these results imply that the efficiency of commercial Bm86-based vaccine against the Iranian H. a. anatolicum may be under the question and indicates the value of the development of Hao3-based recombinant vaccines and further planning for their in vivo evaluation.']
['Enhanced smoking cue salience associated with depression severity in nicotine-dependent individuals: a preliminary fMRI study.', 'The association between cigarette smoking and depression has been well documented; however, little research has been done to elucidate the neurobiological substrates of this highly prevalent comorbidity. We used multiple linear regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between depression severity as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to visual smoking cues in drug-free nicotine-dependent smokers (n=18). Two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were completed over a single study day, following overnight smoking abstinence (pre-smoking scan) and after cigarette reinstatement (post-smoking scan). During the pre-smoking scan positive correlations between BOLD activity and HAMD scores were observed in areas of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system [inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), hippocampus (HC), anterior cingulate gyrus] and areas of the visuospatial attention circuit (medial occipital lobe, middle cingulate cortex, superior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus). During the post-smoking scan positive correlations were observed in areas of the brain implicated in drug expectancy (MFG), memory (HC), attentional motivation (posterior cingulate cortex), and visual processing and attention (precuneus). These preliminary findings demonstrate that smokers with higher depression severity attribute greater incentive salience to smoking-related cues and this is especially pronounced during periods of acute abstinence. Such enhanced salience of smoking cues, even after smoking a cigarette, may play a critical role both in the maintenance of smoking in depression and in greater levels of nicotine dependence seen in this patient population.']
['Presence of an optic disc notch and glaucoma.', 'To assess the prevalence and associations of a notch in the optic disc neural rim.', 'Stereo-photographs from the Blue Mountains Eye Study were graded for the presence of a notch (defined as focal reduction in neural rim width associated with a change in the curvature of the rim for no greater than 4 clock hours).', 'A notch was found in at least 1 eye of 205 participants (5.7%), and was bilateral in 51 (1.4%). Notch prevalence increased with age from 2.48% in participants aged <60 years, to 4.1% for ages 60 to 69 years, 7.98% for ages 70 to 79 years and 15.3% for ages 80 years or older. No sex differences were found. Notches were more frequent in eyes with myopia (odds ratio, OR, 1.98, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.31-2.98) or beta-peripapillary atrophy (OR 2.20, CI 1.52-3.22). No associations were found with intraocular pressure, optic disc hemorrhage, or migraine history. After adjusting for other risk factors, a neural rim notch was strongly associated with glaucoma diagnosis (OR 21.2, CI 8.8-50.8). The sensitivity and specificity for glaucoma with visual field loss of finding a notch in either eye was 90.3% and 96.8%, respectively. The positive predictive value of a notch was 45.4% and negative predictive value 99.7%.', 'A notch in the neural rim is a relatively infrequent sign in normal eyes but is very frequent in glaucoma. This sign has both good sensitivity and a positive predictive value for glaucoma.']

['GGT levels in type II diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome (does diabetes have any effect on GGT levels in acute coronary syndrome?).', 'Elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level is independently correlated with conditions associated with increased atherosclerosis, such as obesity, elevated serum cholesterol, high blood pressure and myocardial infarction. It is demonstrated that serum GGT activity is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease. Diabetes is also a well-known cardiovascular risk factor and an equivalent of coronary artery disease. Although the relationship between GGT and coronary artery disease has been reported, there are limited data exploring the changes of GGT in acute coronary syndromes, especially in patients with diabetes. So, this study aimed to determine changes in GGT level in diabetic and non-diabetic acute coronary syndromes. This trial was carried out at Kosuyolu Cardiovascular Training and Research Hospital and Van Yuksek Ihtisas Hospital, Turkey. A total of 219 patients (177 men and 42 women) presenting with acute coronary syndrome) and 51 control subjects between September 2007 and September 2008 were included in the study. Serum γ-glutamyltransferase and serum lipoprotein levels were determined. The resuls indicated that serum GGT levels were higher in acute coronary syndrome patients compared with control. In subgroup analyses, there was no difference between diabetic and non-diabetic subgroups. There was also weak correlation between GGT and blood glucose levels. There was no correlation between GGT and serum lipoprotein levels. In conclusion, serum GGT levels were higher in acute coronary syndrome patients. In subgroup analyses, There was no difference between diabetic and non diabetic subgroup.']

Frequency and intensity of pain was self-recorded by the subjects.', 'The L. reuteri-supplemented children had significantly lower pain intensity compared with the placebo controls.', 'Supplementation with L. reuteri reduced perceived abdominal pain intensity, which may encourage clinicians to use this probiotic in children with FAP.']
['Effects of renin-angiotensin system blockade on the islet morphology and function in rats with long-term high-fat diet.', 'The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in the endocrine pancreas. Multiple researches have shown that even in the insulin resistance phase, there are many abnormalities in islets morphology and function. This study aimed at investigating the effects of RAS blockade on the islets function in rats with long-term high-fat diet and its mechanisms. Wistar rats with 16-week high-fat diet were randomly divided into perindopril intervention group (FP, n = 15) and telmisartan intervention group (FT, n = 15). After 8-week intervention, insulin sensitivity and islets function were detected by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), respectively. The pancreases were stained by immunohistochemistry technique to qualitatively and\\/or quantitatively analyze the relative content of insulin (IRC), NF-KB, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and caspase-3 in islets. The apoptosis of islet cells was detected by TUNEL. The expression of angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1R), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1α and CHOP mRNA in the islets was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with normal control group (NC, n = 15), the glucose infusion rate (GIR), area under the insulin curve (AUCI) of 0-10 min and IRC were decreased in high-fat control group (FC, n = 15). The relative content of NF-KB, UCP-2 and caspase-3 was increased significantly with the increased number of apoptotic cells in unit islets area. The relative expression of AT1R, IL-1β, HIF-1α and CHOP was also increased evidently (all P < 0.01). After intervention, the GIR, AUCI of 0-10 min and IRC were all increased obviously with the decreased relative concentration of NF-KB, UCP-2, caspase-3 and the number of apoptotic cell in unit islets area. The relative expression of AT1R, IL-1β, HIF-1α and CHOP mRNA was reduced significantly (all P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between groups FP and FT. So we concluded that blockade of RAS may protect islet function of rats with long-term high-fat diet via downregulation of islets inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, which have tight relationship with each other.']
['Surgical treatment of impending paradoxical embolization associated with pulmonary embolism in a patient with heterozygosis of factor V Leiden.', 'We report an unusual case of impending paradoxical embolization in a 69-year-old woman heterozygote carrier of factor V Leiden mutation. The patient presented to the emergency room with the clinical scenario of massive pulmonary embolism. Serial echocardiographic examinations revealed a large thrombus in the right atrium floating via a patent foramen ovale into the left atrium. Anticoagulation therapy was started. After 72 h, due to the unresolved thrombus, the patient underwent surgical treatment consisting of complete excision of the thrombus, closure of the foramen ovale, and pulmonary embolectomy. No in-hospital complications were noted. At 1-year follow-up, the patient is doing well on long-term anticoagulation treatment free of thromboembolic events.']

['Hepatitis B virus reactivation in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.', 'Immunosuppressive therapy, such as chemotherapy or the use of corticosteroids, may stimulate reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Most of these episodes occur in patients whose hepatitis B surface antigens are positive (HBsAg+). We report a case of HBV reactivation in a patient with negative HBsAg during chemotherapy for breast cancer, in spite of avoiding corticosteroids. A 68-year-old woman received adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Her serological examinations showed that HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV-DNA were all negative. Her chemotherapy consisted of CAF (cyclophosphamide 500?mg\\/m(2), doxorubicin 50?mg\\/m(2), fluorouracil 500?mg\\/m(2)) without administration of corticosteroids. She received six cycles of CAF. At day 27 after her sixth CAF, she was admitted to the hospital with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. She received glycyrrhizinic acid by intravenous injection (80?mg\\/day), ursodeoxycholic acid (300?mg\\/day), and entecavir (0.5?mg\\/day). Then she received interferon by intravenous injection (3?million units\\/day), prednisolon by intravenous injection (45?mg\\/day), and plasma exchange therapy. However, she died of liver failure. This is a rare case in which HBV reactivation occurred in an HBsAg negative patient during chemotherapy without using corticosteroids. This episode suggests that HBV reactivation may occur during chemotherapy in any patient with a history of HBV infection. Therefore, we recommend checking HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb before starting chemotherapy. Moreover, with positive HBsAb or\\/and HBcAb patients, HBV-DNA should be checked before starting chemotherapy and monitored during chemotherapy by a sensitive PCR method.']
['Multifocal adamantinoma simulating traumatic pathology on bone scanning.', 'This is a case report of a young physically active patient who presented with pain in the right leg. Plain radiograph and bone scan showed lesions mimicking stress fracture. Follow-up investigations (repeated plain radiography and three phase bone scan) and histopathological examination proved it as a case of multifocal adamantinoma. This report signifies that physicians should not lock their mind only to one entity and keep the differential diagnosis list flexible especially if patient does not respond to a specific treatment. Tibial adamantinoma should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of stress fracture. Further, second lesion can occur in the rib cage defying the common belief that second lesion will be in the adjacent bone, fibula.']

['Targeting apoptosis pathways by natural compounds in cancer: marine compounds as lead structures and chemical tools for cancer therapy.', 'Natural compounds derived from marine organisms have shown a wide variety of anti-tumor effects and a lot of attention has been drawn to further development of the isolated compounds. A vast quantity of individual chemical structures from different organisms has shown a variety of apoptosis inducing mechanisms in a variety of tumor cells. The bis-steroidal cephalostatin 1 for example, induces apoptosis via activation of caspases whereas the polyketide discodermolide inhibits cell growth by binding to and stabilizing microtubule and salisporamide A, the product of an actinobacterial strain, is an inhibitor of the proteasome. This great variety of mechanisms of action can help to overcome the multitude of resistances exhibited by different tumor specimens. Products from marine organisms and their synthetic derivates are therefore an important source for new therapeutics for single agent or combined therapy with other chemotherapeutics to support the struggle against cancer.']
['Negative correlation between serum syndecan-1 and apolipoprotein A1 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and lipid metabolism in vitro. Syndecans are the primary form of HSPGs. Syndecan-1 is involved in the processes of cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, wound healing and inflammation. Additionally, as a sinusoidal transmembrane HSPG facing the plasma compartment, syndecan-1 is a promising target to be involved in lipoprotein physiology. We aimed to examine the possible correlation of syndecan-1 and lipid profile in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, serum syndecan-1 was detected by ELISA, and potential correlations between syndecan-1 and triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein a, apolipoprotein (apo) B, apoA1 and apoB\\/apoA1 were analyzed. Forty-one patients with type 2 diabetes and 31 age-matched, non-diabetic healthy subjects (controls) were enrolled. Syndecan-1 in patients with diabetes (26.15?±?2.42?ng\\/ml) was significantly higher than that of the controls (16.85?±?1.98?ng\\/ml, t?=?-2.98, P?=?0.005). Serum syndecan-1 level correlated negatively with apoA1 (r?=?-0.46, P?=?0.003).

['Antagonists of IAP proteins as cancer therapeutics.', 'Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins play pivotal roles in cellular survival by blocking apoptosis, modulating signal transduction, and affecting cellular proliferation. Through their interactions with inducers and effectors of apoptosis IAP proteins can effectively suppress apoptosis triggered by diverse stimuli including death receptor signaling, irradiation, chemotherapeutic agents, or growth factor withdrawal. Evasion of apoptosis, in part due to the action of IAP proteins, enhances resistance of cancer cells to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and contributes to tumor progression. Additionally, IAP genes are known to be subject to amplification, mutation, and chromosomal translocation in human malignancies and autoimmune diseases. In this review we will discuss the role of IAP proteins in cancer and the development of antagonists targeting IAP proteins for cancer treatment.']
['Targeting apoptosis pathways in cancer by Chinese medicine.', 'The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses a combination of different natural products based on practical experiences. To better understand the therapeutic functions of TCM, large efforts have been made to identify the principle constituents of TCM and to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind the efficacy observed. This review aims to summarize research results obtained from the most intensively studied TCM phytochemical compounds namely the alkaloids Berberine, Evodiamine; anthraquinones Emodin, Aloe-emodin, Rhein; the terpenoids Artemisinin, Celastrol, Triptolide; the flavones Apigenin, Chrysin, Wogonin, Baicalein; and the cyclopenta[b]benzofuran derivatives Rocaglamide. Most of them have been originally identified as anti-inflammatory and anti-viral reagents and are now known to also possess anti-tumor activities by targeting the apoptosis pathways in cancer. This review also intends to give an overview of the mechanisms of action identified so far. These breakthrough findings may have important implications for targeted-cancer therapy and for modernization of TCM.']

['Cooperative medical insurance and the cost of care in Shandong, PR China: perspectives of patients and community members.', "This research was conducted to identify the cost of care associated with utilization of village clinics and membership of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in 2 counties of Shandong province, PR China. A total of 397 community members and 297 patients who used the village clinics were interviewed. The average cost for primary care treatment of 1 episode of illness was about 55 yuan (about US$8). Although more than 50% of people had NCMS membership, many consider the monetary reimbursements as insufficient. The low insurance reimbursement rates and inability to pay out-of-pocket expenses compromise access to care. Delays can cause more serious illnesses with potential to overburden the secondary care at the township and county hospitals. Those rural people who have not yet enjoyed the benefits of China's economic development may not benefit from recent health care reform and finance mechanisms unless schemes such as the NCMS provide more substantial subsidies."]

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy, therefore, should be considered an occasional manifestation of a paraneoplastic syndrome warranting a thorough search for underlying malignancy.']
['[Donor site preserved skin grafts. A clinical study of 10 cases].', 'In spite of a rigorous technique, a graft will not necessarily completely take on a burned area. We propose to preserve on the donor site the excess skin graft harvested during the excision-graft procedure.', 'A clinical study was carried out in nine patients who had their excess skin graft preserved at the time of excision-graft for deep burn. The unused fragments of skin graft were preserved on the donor site. In the event of a small skin graft failure, the preserved skin graft was separated from its donor site and used as a new skin graft during wound dressing.', 'Nine patients required the use of 10 preserved skin grafts. The average age was 54years and the average burned third degree surface was 17% total body surface area. In seven procedures for six patients, the preserved skin graft was taken off without pain and was used with a complete take. In three cases, the preserved skin graft was not used because in two cases, the take of the initial skin graft was complete and in one case, a definitely insufficient take required reoperation.', 'The preservation and use of the skin graft as a complement was simple and useful and made it possible to easily complete a skin graft when the initial take was incomplete. It would appear to be efficient in burn surgery since it accelerates cicatrisation and avoids the need for a new graft harvesting procedure.']
['Targeting ER stress induced apoptosis and inflammation in cancer.', "Disturbance in the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), caused by a variety of endogenous and exogenous insults, prompts a cellular stress condition known as ER stress. ER stress is initially shaped to re-establish ER homeostasis through the activation of an integrated intracellular signal transduction pathway termed as unfolded protein response (UPR). However, when ER stress is too severe or prolonged, the pro-survival function of the UPR turns into a toxic signal, which is predominantly executed by mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, accumulating evidence implicates ER stress pathways in the activation of various 'classical' inflammatory processes in and around the tumour microenvironment. In fact, ER stress pathways evoked by certain conventional or experimental anticancer modalities have been found to promote anti-tumour immunity by enhancing immunogenicity of dying cancer cells. Thus, the ER functions as an essential sensing organelle capable of coordinating stress pathways crucially involved in maintaining the cross-talk between the cancer cell's intracellular and extracellular environment. In this review we discuss the emerging link between ER stress, cell fate decisions and immunomodulation and the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting this multifaceted signaling pathway in anticancer therapy."]

['Comparative validity of the WHO-5 Well-Being Index and two-question instrument for screening depressive symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes.', 'A simple tool consisting of two questions for screening depressive symptoms has been shown to be useful in primary care settings, but its validity in patients with diabetes has yet to be evaluated. We compared the test performance of this two-question instrument with that of WHO (The World Health Organization)-5. We consecutively enrolled 153 patients with type 2 diabetes who visited a diabetes clinic in Japan. Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale as a reference standard of depressive symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the two-question instrument and WHO-5, and compared the area under the ROC curves of these tests. The two-question instrument had a sensitivity of 53.6% (95% CI, 39.7-67.0%) and specificity of 67.7% (95% CI, 58.1-74.9%). With the conventional cutoff point equal to or less than 13 points, the WHO-5 had a sensitivity of 57.1% (95% CI, 43.2-70.3%) and specificity of 82.5% (95% CI, 81.9-94.9%). The area under the ROC curve for the WHO-5 and two-item questionnaire, an indicator of discriminatory power, was 0.81 and 0.73, respectively, showing a statistically significant difference (P?=?0.0453). The two-question instrument had statistically lower discriminatory power than the WHO-5 in screening depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes. We do not recommend the use of the two-question instrument for screening depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes.']

['Caspase-8 as a therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Caspase-8 is an apical caspase which initiates programmed cell death following death receptor ligation. This central role in apoptosis has prompted significant clinical interest in regulating caspase-8 expression and proteolytic activity. However, caspase-8 has also been found to play a number of non-apoptotic roles in cells, such as promoting activation NF-κB signaling, regulating autophagy and altering endosomal trafficking, and enhancing cellular adhesion and migration. Therefore, depending upon the specific cellular context, caspase-8 may either potentiate or suppress tumor malignancy. Accordingly, a marked heterogeneity exists in the expression patterns of caspase-8 among different tumor types. Therapeutics have been developed which can increase caspase-8 expression, yet it remains unclear whether this approach will be beneficial in all cases. Care is warranted, and the role of caspase-8 should be addressed on a case by case basis.']
['The impact of smoking on incident type 2 diabetes in a cohort with hepatitis B but not hepatitis C infection.', 'Smoking may be a risk factor for diabetes, and it has been suggested that viral hepatitis may predispose to diabetes. We studied diabetes and smoking histories in people with viral hepatitis. From 1997 to 2004, we studied the risk of incident diabetes in a community cohort with hyperendemic HBV and HCV infection in southern Taiwan. The cohort involved 3539 people (40-70?years old) without diabetes. Four hundred and twenty-three individuals developed diabetes. Those who were ≥65?years old, frequently consumed alcohol, had a BMI ≥25, had <9?years of education, were anti-HCV+ or smoked ≥1 pack per day were more likely to develop diabetes (P?<?0.05). A cumulative hazard function test showed that the higher the smoking levels, the greater the cumulative incidence rate of diabetes in HBsAg+ participants only (P?=?0.03 by log-rank test). A multiple Cox proportional hazards model analysis in different hepatitis statuses showed smoking levels were strong predictors of diabetes with a dose-response relationship for type 2 diabetes in those with HBsAg+ : hazard ratio (HR)?=?3.8, (95% CI: 1.2, 12.3) for light smokers (<1 pack per day) and HR?=?4.4 (95% CI: 1.5, 13.3) for heavy smokers (≥1 pack per day). Increasing BMI was a common predictor in all people. Smoking is a strong predictor for diabetes with a dose-response relationship in HBsAg+ individuals and a mild predictor for seronegative individuals but not significant in anti-HCV+ individuals.']

['Oncogenic role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 in tumorigenesis of urinary bladder cancer.', 'Bladder cancer is the second most common genitourinary tumor and constitutes a very heterogeneous disease. Molecular and pathologic studies suggest that low-grade noninvasive and high-grade invasive urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) arise via distinct pathways. Low-grade noninvasive UCC represent the majority of tumors at presentation. A high proportion of patients with low-grade UCC develop recurrences but usually with no progression to invasive disease. At presentation, a majority of the bladder tumors (70%-80%) are low-grade noninvasive (pTa). Several genetic changes may occur in bladder cancer, but activating mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes are the most common and most specific genetic abnormality in bladder cancer. Interestingly, these mutations are associated with bladder tumors of low stage and grade, which makes the FGFR3 mutation the first marker that can be used for diagnosis of noninvasive bladder tumors. Since the first report of FGFR3 involvement in bladder tumors, numerous studies have been conducted to understand its function and thereby confirm the oncogenic role of this receptor particularly in noninvasive groups. Efforts are on to exploit this receptor as a therapeutic target, which holds much promise in the treatment of bladder cancer, particularly low-grade noninvasive tumors. Further studies need to explore the potential use of FGFR3 mutations in bladder cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and in surveillance of patients with bladder cancer. This review focuses on the role of FGFR3 in bladder tumors in the backdrop of various studies published.']

['Simultaneous premaxillary repositioning and cheiloplasty in adult patients with unrepaired bilateral cleft lip and palate.', 'Primary cheiloplasty in adult patients with unrepaired complete bilateral cleft lip and palate is quite challenging due to severe premaxillary anterior projection. To get the best repair results, the author carried out repositioning of the premaxilla and repair of the lip deformity in a single stage. Positive results for the primary lip repair and appropriate repositioning of the premaxilla were achieved. No avascular necrosis of the premaxilla was observed. Repositioning of the premaxilla and repair of the lip deformity in a single operation appears to be a reliable method for treating adult patients with previously unrepaired or poorly repaired bilateral cleft lip and palate.']
['Recent and emerging therapeutic medications in type 2 diabetes mellitus: incretin-based, Pramlintide, Colesevelam, SGLT2 Inhibitors, Tagatose, Succinobucol.', 'Nearly 285 million people worldwide, with 10% being Americans, suffer from diabetes mellitus and its associated comorbidities. This is projected to increase by 6.5% per year, with 439 million inflicted by year 2030. Both morbidity and mortality from diabetes stem from the consequences of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Of the 285 million with diabetes, over a quarter of a million die per year from related complications, making diabetes the fifth leading cause of death in high-income countries. These startling statistics illustrate the therapeutic failure of current diabetes drugs to retard the progression of diabetes. These statistics further illustrate the continual need for further research and development of alternative drugs with novel mechanisms to slow disease progression and disease complications. The treatment algorithm updated in 2008 by American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes currently recommends the traditional medications of metformin, either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin, as the preferred choice in the tier 1 option. The algorithm only suggests addition of alternative medications such as pioglitazone and incretin-based drugs as second-line agents in the tier 2 "less well-validated" option. However, these traditional medications have not proven to delay the progressive course of diabetes as evidence of increasing need over time for multiple drug therapy to maintain sufficient glycemic control. Because current diabetes medications have limited efficacy and untoward side effects, the development of diabetes mellitus drugs with newer mechanisms of action continues. This article will review the clinical data on the newly available incretin-based drugs on the market, including glucagon-like peptide agonists and of dipeptidyl peptidase type-4 inhibitors. It will also discuss 2 unique medications: pramlintide, which is indicated for both type and type-2 diabetes, and colesevelam, which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for both type-2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. It will further review the clinical data on the novel emerging agents of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, tagatose, and succinobucol, all currently in phase III clinical trials. This review article can serve as an aid for clinicians to identify clinical indications in which these new agents can be applied in the treatment algorithm.']

['Current chemotherapeutic options for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer: a review.', 'Advanced bladder cancer is a disease with a high recurrence rate and metastatic capacity exhibiting a poor outcome. The pathologic stage and nodal involvement are independent prognostic factors for survival after cystectomy, and in locally advanced or metastatic disease, the performance status and the presence of visceral metastases have been correlated with treatment outcome. The regimen methotrexate-vinblastine-adriamycin-cisplatin (MVAC) has been the treatment of choice for decades and later the combination of cisplatin with gemcitabine became also the new standard of care, by demonstrating a more favorable toxicity profile. Also, carboplatin-gemcitabine and taxanes have been useful alternatives for patients unfit for cisplatin-based treatment. Additionally, the evaluation of certain chemotherapeutic agents has produced promising results in the second-line setting. Lastly, the past decade has provided information on the molecular mechanism of bladder cancer offering a personalized approach and optimizing the management of the disease.']
['Comparison of the efficacy of three PubMed search filters in finding randomized controlled trials to answer clinical questions.', 'The aim of this study was to compare the performance of three search methods in the retrieval of relevant clinical trials from PubMed to answer specific clinical questions.', 'Included studies of a sample of 100 Cochrane reviews which recorded in PubMed were considered as the reference standard. The search queries were formulated based on the systematic review titles. Precision, recall and number of retrieved records for limiting the results to clinical trial publication type, and using sensitive and specific clinical queries filters were compared. The number of keywords, presence of specific names of intervention and syndrome in the search keywords were used in a model to predict the recalls and precisions.', 'The Clinical queries-sensitive search strategy retrieved the largest number of records (33) and had the highest recall (41.6%) and lowest precision (4.8%). The presence of specific intervention name was the only significant predictor of all recalls and precisions (P = 0.016).', 'The recall and precision of combination of simple clinical search queries and methodological search filters to find clinical trials in various subjects were considerably low. The limit field strategy yielded in higher precision and fewer retrieved records and approximately similar recall, compared with the clinical queries-sensitive strategy. Presence of specific intervention name in the search keywords increased both recall and precision.']
['Use of genomic data in risk assessment case study: I. Evaluation of the dibutyl phthalate male reproductive development toxicity data set.', 'A case study was conducted, using dibutyl phthalate (DBP), to explore an approach to using toxicogenomic data in risk assessment. The toxicity and toxicogenomic data sets relative to DBP-related male reproductive developmental outcomes were considered conjointly to derive information about mode and mechanism of action. In this manuscript, we describe the case study evaluation of the toxicological database for DBP, focusing on identifying the full spectrum of male reproductive developmental effects. The data were assessed to 1) evaluate low dose and low incidence findings and 2) identify male reproductive toxicity endpoints without well-established modes of action (MOAs). These efforts led to the characterization of data gaps and research needs for the toxicity and toxicogenomic studies in a risk assessment context. Further, the identification of endpoints with unexplained MOAs in the toxicity data set was useful in the subsequent evaluation of the mechanistic information that the toxicogenomic data set evaluation could provide. The extensive analysis of the toxicology data set within the MOA context provided a resource of information for DBP in attempts to hypothesize MOAs (for endpoints without a well-established MOA) and to phenotypically anchor toxicogenomic and other mechanistic data both to toxicity endpoints and to available toxicogenomic data. This case study serves as an example of the steps that can be taken to develop a toxicological data source for a risk assessment, both in general and especially for risk assessments that include toxicogenomic data.']
['Pathway modeling of microarray data: a case study of pathway activity changes in the testis following in utero exposure to dibutyl phthalate (DBP).', 'Pathway activity level analysis, the approach pursued in this study, focuses on all genes that are known to be members of metabolic and signaling pathways as defined by the KEGG database. The pathway activity level analysis entails singular value decomposition (SVD) of the expression data of the genes constituting a given pathway. We explore an extension of the pathway activity methodology for application to time-course microarray data. We show that pathway analysis enhances our ability to detect biologically relevant changes in pathway activity using synthetic data. As a case study, we apply the pathway activity level formulation coupled with significance analysis to microarray data from two different rat testes exposed in utero to Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP). In utero DBP exposure in the rat results in developmental toxicity of a number of male reproductive organs, including the testes. One well-characterized mode of action for DBP and the male reproductive developmental effects is the repression of expression of genes involved in cholesterol transport, steroid biosynthesis and testosterone synthesis that lead to a decreased fetal testicular testosterone. Previous analyses of DBP testes microarray data focused on either individual gene expression changes or changes in the expression of specific genes that are hypothesized, or known, to be important in testicular development and testosterone synthesis. However, a pathway analysis may inform whether there are additional affected pathways that could inform additional modes of action linked to DBP developmental toxicity. We show that Pathway activity analysis may be considered for a more comprehensive analysis of microarray data.']
['Enzyme sequence similarity improves the reaction alignment method for cross-species pathway comparison.', 'Pathway-based information has become an important source of information for both establishing evolutionary relationships and understanding the mode of action of a chemical or pharmaceutical among species. Cross-species comparison of pathways can address two broad questions: comparison in order to inform evolutionary relationships and to extrapolate species differences used in a number of different applications including drug and toxicity testing. Cross-species comparison of metabolic pathways is complex as there are multiple features of a pathway that can be modeled and compared. Among the various methods that have been proposed, reaction alignment has emerged as the most successful at predicting phylogenetic relationships based on NCBI taxonomy. We propose an improvement of the reaction alignment method by accounting for sequence similarity in addition to reaction alignment method. Using nine species, including human and some model organisms and test species, we evaluate the standard and improved comparison methods by analyzing glycolysis and citrate cycle pathways conservation. In addition, we demonstrate how organism comparison can be conducted by accounting for the cumulative information retrieved from nine pathways in central metabolism as well as a more complete study involving 36 pathways common in all nine species. Our results indicate that reaction alignment with enzyme sequence similarity results in a more accurate representation of pathway specific cross-species similarities and differences based on NCBI taxonomy.']

['Diversity of Orientia tsutsugamushi clinical isolates in Cambodia reveals active selection and recombination process.', 'Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus in South East Asia and Pacific, is an obligate intracellular bacterium closely related to the Rickettsia. The pathogen is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected larvae of trombiculid mites of the genus Leptotrombidium in which is maintained trough vertical transmission mechanism. The infection in rodents has been described in over 20 species. Scrub typhus is commonly confused with other tropical fevers and late diagnosis and treatment can lead to severe organ failures and a strain-dependent mortality rate of up to 50%. A MLST scheme associating seven core function genes: adk, lepB, lipA, lipB, secY, sodB and sucA was developed and validated on seven Cambodian strains detected in patients and two complete reference genomes from Korea and Japan. Sequence data were analyzed both with respect to sequence type (ST) diversity and DNA polymorphism. Differing trends were revealed. DNA polymorphism and phylogeny of individual gene loci indicated a significant level of recombination and genetic diversity. However, the ST distribution is clearly clonal and the clinical situation can be summarized by the formula: one patient, one strain, one ST. This contradiction is only apparent and is most likely the consequence of the unique life cycle of O. tsutsugamushi. The quasi exclusive vertical transmission mode in mites generates repeated bottlenecks and small-size populations and strongly limits genetic diversity. O. tsutsugamushi has developed specific mechanisms for generating genetic diversity which include recombination, duplication and conjugation. Recombination and other mechanisms for increasing genetic diversity are likely to occur in rodents which can act as maintenance hosts, although occurrence in mites cannot be excluded. Consequences for the epidemiology of scrub typhus are discussed.']
['Diabetes mellitus and its impact on long-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis and increases cardiovascular disease. Several studies found a higher mortality rate in postoperative diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients. However, other studies found conflicting evidence on bypass graft dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus. We therefore investigated the influence of diabetes mellitus on the long-term outcome after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). In this prospective study, 936 consecutive CABG patients were included. These patients were divided into three groups: patients without diabetes mellitus, patients with diabetes mellitus using oral drugs (non-insulin-treated DM) and patients with diabetes mellitus using insulin (insulin-treated DM). The three groups were compared for mortality and (angiographic) bypass graft dysfunction. Of the 936 included patients, 720 (76.8%) patients were non-diabetics, 138 (14.7%) were non-insulin-treated DM, and 78 (8.3%) patients were insulin-treated DM. Follow-up was achieved in all patients, at a mean of 33 months. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with insulin-treated DM, compared with non-insulin-treated DM or non-diabetic patients (P = 0.003). Fourteen (1.5%) patients suffered a myocardial infarction after CABG. A coronary angiography was performed in 77 (8.2%) patients during follow-up, proven bypass graft dysfunction was found in 41 (53.2%) patients. There was no significant difference in bypass graft dysfunction between the three groups. Diabetes mellitus has a significant impact on long-term follow-up after coronary surgery. Particularly insulin dependency is related to an increased mortality. However, diabetes has no influence on angiographically proven bypass graft dysfunction.']

Radiologic signs of orbital inflammation were absent. Testing of visual acuity and visual field allowed close monitoring of disease activity. Thus, rapid improvement of visual function was achieved with high-dose steroids. Despite maintenance therapy with cyclophosphamide recurrence occurred repeatedly as soon as tapering of steroids was begun. After remission induction with rituximab, the patient retained good visual function under maintenance therapy with azathioprine and low-dose corticosteroids. Optic neuritis in Wegener's granulomatosis without signs of orbital involvement is rare and most likely caused by occlusive vasculitis of the vasa nervorum. In this patient with optic neuritis refractory to conventional therapy, rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids was well tolerated and successfully used for remission induction, followed by maintenance therapy with azathioprine and low dose corticosteroids."]

['Robot-assisted extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a review of the current literature.', 'Prostate cancer remains a significant health problem worldwide and is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in men. While there is uncertainty over which men will benefit from radical treatment, considerable efforts are being made to reduce treatment related side-effects and in optimizing outcomes. The current gold standard treatment for localized prostate cancer remains open radical prostatectomy. Since the early 1990s, several teams have tried to explore less invasive surgical access. The first robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) case was reported in 2000. Enhancement of the ergonomics and optimization of the surgical vision provided by the robotic interface are some of the reasons that explain the worldwide wide spread of RALP. Although this procedure accounted for the vast majority of radical prostatectomies performed in United States, its diffusion is still limited in Europe. The cost for robot purchase and maintenance are obvious limiting factors for its expansion. According to the literature, the operating time and the blood loss are, once the learning curve is completed, similar to those of open or laparoscopic procedures. Hospital stay and time before bladder catheter removal are shorter compared with other approaches. Intermediate oncologic and functional outcomes do not show difference with the open or laparoscopic results. Given that these data are encouraging, the limited follow-up with RALP does not allow drawing any definitive statement in comparison with conventional techniques. The aim of our study was to underline the perioperative, oncologic, and functional outcomes of all extraperitoneal RALP series published.']
['Impact of Postoperative Morbidity on Long-Term Survival After Resection for Colorectal Liver Metastases.', 'Although correlation of postoperative morbidity with long-term survival is recognized to influence long-term survival after other cancer surgery, little information exists about the impact of postoperative morbidity on patient outcomes following liver resection for colorectal metastases.', 'We studied the impact of postoperative morbidity on long-term survival after liver resection for colorectal cancer metastases using data from 312 patients with curative hepatectomy.', 'Among all 312 patients evaluated, 98 complications occurred, affecting 80 patients (26%). The 80 patients with morbidity had a lower disease-free rate (P?=?0.03), resulting in poor overall survival (P?=?0.02) compared with the group with no morbidity (n?=?232). Decreases in disease-free and overall survival also were associated with severity of postoperative complications. When patients were divided according to extent of metastases, little impact of morbidity on overall survival (P?=?0.10) and disease-free rate (P?=?0.35) was demonstrated in patients whose metastases were less advanced.

['International policies and strategies for the remediation of land contaminated by radioactive material residues.', "The paper addresses the international policies and strategies for the remediation of land contaminated by radioactive material residue, its main aim being to describe the misunderstandings, evolution and status of the international paradigms in this area. Thus, the denotation and connotation of the 'remediation' and 'contamination' concepts are explored, including the ambiguity they produce in understanding of the issues by a sceptical public. Then, the international radiation protection approaches for remediation are portrayed. They derive from the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), which are described including their basic principles and characterization of exposure situations. Prolonged exposure situations, which are typical in cases of contaminated land, are analysed with particular detail. The newer ICRP general recommendations, as well as recent ICRP recommendations for excluding and exempting exposure situations from regulatory control and for living in long-term contaminated territories after a nuclear accident or a radiation emergency, are examined. Remediation vis-à-vis environmental protection is discussed and the non-technical factors usually involved in decision-making on remediation are examined. Finally, the international safety standards on remediation, which are being established under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are explored. These include the well established International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources, or BSS, as well as the specific international safety requirements for remediation; a brief overview of the current process of revising the BSS is also included. In its outcome the paper suggests that the time is ripe for a simple and clear international agreement on the levels of radioactivity in territorial contamination with radioactive material that may be considered unambiguously safe."]

The authors insist on the interest of a preoperative diagnosis with the IRM, which permits to envisage surgical difficulties due to the proximity of vascular and nervous pedicles.']
['Functionally-detected cognitive impairment in high school football players without clinically-diagnosed concussion.', 'Head trauma and concussion in football players have recently received considerable media attention. Postmortem evidence suggests that accrual of damage to the brain may occur with repeated blows to the head, even when the individual blows fail to produce clinical symptoms. There is an urgent need for improved detection and characterization of head trauma to reduce future injury risk and promote development of new therapies. In this study we examined neurological performance and health in the presence of head collision events in high school football players, using longitudinal measures of collision events (the HIT(?) System), neurocognitive testing (ImPACT(?)), and functional magnetic resonance imaging MRI (fMRI). Longitudinal assessment (including baseline) was conducted in 11 young men (ages 15-19 years) participating on the varsity and junior varsity football teams at a single high school. We expected and observed subjects in two previously described categories: (1) no clinically-diagnosed concussion and no changes in neurological behavior, and (2) clinically-diagnosed concussion with changes in neurological behavior. Additionally, we observed players in a previously undiscovered third category, who exhibited no clinically-observed symptoms associated with concussion, but who demonstrated measurable neurocognitive (primarily visual working memory) and neurophysiological (altered activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]) impairments. This new category was associated with significantly higher numbers of head collision events to the top-front of the head, directly above the DLPFC. The discovery of this new category suggests that more players are suffering neurological injury than are currently being detected using traditional concussion-assessment tools. These individuals are unlikely to undergo clinical evaluation, and thus may continue to participate in football-related activities, even when changes in brain physiology (and potential brain damage) are present, which will increase the risk of future neurological injury.']
['Risk management of undesirable substances in feed following updated risk assessments.', 'Directive 2002\\/32\\/EC of 7 May 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on undesirable substances in animal feed is the framework for the EU action on undesirable substances in feed. This framework Directive provides: Based on the provisions and principles laid down in this framework Directive, maximum levels for a whole range of undesirable substances have been established at EU level. During the discussions in view of the adoption of Directive 2002\\/32\\/EC, the European Commission made the commitment to review all existing provisions on undesirable substances on the basis of updated scientific risk assessments. Following requests of the European Commission, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has completed a series of 30 risk assessments undertaken over the last 5years on undesirable substances in animal feed reviewing the possible risks for animal and human health due to the presence of these substances in animal feed. EU legislation on undesirable substances has undergone recently several changes to take account of these most recent scientific opinions. Furthermore EFSA has assessed the risks for public and animal health following the unavoidable carry-over of coccidiostats into non target feed. Maximum levels for the unavoidable carry-over have been established for the non-target feed and the food of animal origin from non-target animal species.']

This paper describes a justification of the remediation strategies suggested for rehabilitation of the areas most affected by the Chernobyl accident based on this experience.']
['The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of urothelial cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT-UCC).', 'Urothelial cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT-UCC) is a rare, aggressive urologic cancer with a propensity for multifocality, local recurrence, and metastasis. This review highlights the main chemotherapy regimens available for UUT-UCCs based on the recent literature.', 'Data on urothelial malignancies and UUT-UCCs management in the literature were searched using MEDLINE and by matching the following key words: urinary tract cancer; urothelial carcinomas; upper urinary tract; carcinoma; transitional cell; renal pelvis; ureter; bladder cancer; chemotherapy; nephroureterectomy; adjuvant treatment; neoadjuvant treatment; recurrence; risk factors; and survival.', 'No evidence level 1 information from prospective randomized trials was available. Because of its many similarities with bladder urothelial carcinomas, chemotherapy with a cisplatin-containing regimen is often proposed in patients with metastatic or locally advanced disease. Most teams have proposed a neoadjuvant or an adjuvant treatment based either on the combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin (MVAC) or on gemcitabine\\/cisplatin (GC). These regimens have been shown to prolong survival moderately. All recent studies have included limited numbers of patients and have reported poor patient outcomes after both neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Regarding metastatic UUT-UCCs, vinflunine has demonstrated moderate activity in these patients with a manageable toxicity. Interestingly, specific molecular markers [microsatellite instability (MSI), E-cadherin, HIF-1α, and RNA levels of the telomerase gene] can provide useful information that can help diagnose and determine patient prognosis in patients with UUT-UCC.', "Chemotherapy with a cisplatin-containing regimen is often proposed in patients with metastatic or locally advanced disease. However, there is no strong evidence that chemotherapy is effective due to the rarity of the disease and the lack of data in the current literature. Thus, physicians must take into account the specific clinical characteristics of each individual patient with regard to renal function, medical comorbidities, tumor location, grade, and stage, and molecular marker status when determining the optimal treatment regimen for their patients. The ongoing identification of the oncologic mechanisms of this type of cancer might pave the way for the development of specific treatments that are targeted to the characteristics of each patient's tumor in the future."]
['Unique clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of urinary bladder tumors in children and young adults.', 'In children and young adults, urothelial carcinoma and other epithelial neoplasms of the urinary bladder are rare. When these tumors do occur, they appear to exhibit unique clinicopathologic features, with preferentially low-grade morphology and decreased likelihood of recurrence and progression, although some debate exists regarding their biologic behavior. In contrast, a subset of soft tissue tumors is more commonly seen in pediatric patients, with rhabdomyosarcoma being the most common malignancy in this location. Likewise, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor may be a source of differential diagnostic complexity. In the setting of previous bladder augmentation, patients appear to have a distinctive disposition to develop epithelial neoplasms later in life. Data regarding the molecular characteristics and clinical behavior of pediatric bladder tumors are, with the exception of rhabdomyosarcoma, less well understood than those of adult\\/elderly patients. In this article, we review the distinguishing features of urinary bladder neoplasms in pediatric and young adult patients, with special emphasis on unique clinicopathologic features, molecular-genetic abnormalities, and syndromic associations of urothelial neoplasms in this patient population.']
['Edentulous maxillary arch fixed implant rehabilitation using a hybrid prosthesis made of micro-ceramic-composite: case report.', 'The prosthetic treatment of patients with an edentulous maxilla opposing mandibular natural teeth is one of the most challenging endeavors that face clinicians. Occlusal forces from the opposing natural teeth may cause fractures in the maxillary prosthesis and also result in advanced bone loss of the edentulous maxilla. With the presence of extreme gagging reflex, the treatment may become more complicated. This article describes and illustrates the 2-stage surgical and prosthetic treatment of a patient with an edentulous maxilla opposing natural teeth. In the beginning, the patient was treated with 4 implants and a maxillary implant-supported overdenture. The extreme gagging reflex and the occlusal forces from the mandibular natural teeth obligated the team a second stage surgical and prosthetic treatment, which included increasing the number of implants after bilateral sinus lifting in the posterior maxilla and fabricating a maxillary fixed hybrid prosthesis made of micro-ceramic composite that yielded a satisfactory result.']
['The causality quandary in a patient with stroke, Takotsubo syndrome and severe coronary artery disease.', 'Takotsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction syndrome (TLVDS) and acute coronary syndrome have almost always the same clinical presentation and ECG findings. Both diseases may become a potential cardioembolic source to the cerebrovascular system. Stroke has been linked to TLVDS either as the trigger or as a complication. We report on a 67-year-old female patient who presented with an acute ischemic stroke confirmed by computed tomographic scan of the brain. She also had electrocardiographic features and laboratory findings suggestive of both acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and TLVDS. Coronary angiography revealed severe coronary artery stenoses but the coronary lesions did not have any of the features suggestive of an acute pathology. Echocardiography and left ventriculography showed a striking apical ballooning of the left ventricle, which resolved completely within 1 week, a clinical picture and course typical for TLVDS. There were no signs of left ventricular thrombus. A few burning questions arose from this case: what was the acute cardiac disease - TLVDS or AMI? Which disease came first - the stroke or the acute cardiac illness? An intricate cause-effect relationship is discussed; and finally, does an obstructive coronary artery disease rule out TLVDS?']
["Case report. Elbow monoarthritis revealing B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "Skeletal involvement is described in 25% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, typically as secondary, rarely as primary lymphoma of bone. Joint infiltration is very rare and monoarthritis can be a secondary synovial reaction to adjacent bone disease or direct synovial involvement. We describe an unusual case of monoarthritis of the elbow in a middle-aged man without signs and\\/or symptoms associated with malignancy and with no previous rheumatic disease. Synovial biopsy revealed a diffuse infiltrate of large atypical lymphocytic B cells diagnosed by morphological and immunohistochemical findings as a malignant lymphoma. Staging procedures including total body CT scan, bone marrow biopsy, technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy were normal. We discuss the case and the review of literature and suggest that in the evaluation of patients with an unclassified arthritis, synovial or bone biopsy should be strongly considered."]
['Relationships between maximal oxygen uptake and endothelial function in healthy male adults: a preliminary study.', 'Aerobic capacity, as indicated by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) has an important role in contrasting the traditional cardiovascular risk factors and preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is known that endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, is strictly linked to atherogenesis and cardiovascular risk. However, the relationship between VO2 max and FMD has not been fully investigated especially in healthy non-obese subjects. This preliminary study cross-sectionally investigated the relationship between VO2 max and FMD in 22 non-obese, healthy sedentary male subjects. Dividing the cohort in two subgroups of 11 subjects each according to the median value of VO2 max, the FMD was significantly lower in the subgroup with lower VO2 max (mean?±?sem: 7.1?±?0.7 vs. 9.5?±?0.8 %; P?=?0.035). Absolute VO2 max (mL?min(-1)) was significantly and independently correlated with body fat mass (r?=?-0.50; P?=?0.018) and with FMD (r?=?0.44; P?=?0.039). This preliminary study suggests that maximal oxygen uptake is independently correlated with endothelial function in healthy non-obese adults. These results are also in agreement with the possibility that improving maximal oxygen uptake may have a favorable effect on endothelial function and vice versa.']
['The prevalence and characteristics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and its relation with chronic complications in a clinical department of a university hospital in Korea.', 'Few studies were performed to evaluate the prevalence of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and the difference of chronic complications between LADA, T1DM, and T2DM in Korean. The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence of LADA in a diabetic clinic of Soonchunhyang University hospital and to compare the phenotypic characteristics according to DM classification based on positivity of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA). Also, another important point concerns the occurrence of diabetes chronic microvascular complications in LADA. 323 patients who were checked GADA among diabetic patients admitted at Soonchunhyang University hospital were recruited. Twenty-eight patients (8.7%) were identified as positive for GADA. 11.5% (n?=?37) were diagnosed with T1DM and 5.3% (n?=?17) were diagnosed with LADA. GADA titer showed significant negative correlation with age of onset, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), fasting C-peptide, stimulated C-peptide, BMI, and positive correlation with HbA1C and HDL-C. Compared with those that tested negative for GADA, patients with GADA positive had lower values of onset age, BMI, TC, TG, LDL-C, fasting, and stimulated C-peptide levels and higher values of HbA1C. A significant gradual increase of values was observed for the onset age, BMI, SBP, DBP, fasting, and stimulated C-peptide across the T1DM, LADA, and T2DM subgroups. Concerning the chronic complications there was no difference in prevalence of retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy between three groups. Of LADA patients, 12 patients were receiving insulin treatment and mean time to insulin initiation was about 37?months. In conclusion, because our study suggests LADA subgroups in Korea appear to have a faster decline in C-peptide levels, it is worth detecting the patients with LADA early and effort to preserve beta cell function. Furthermore, our results showed that the prevalence of microvascular complication was comparable between the subgroups.']

['Targeting apoptosis pathways in lung cancer.', 'Lung cancer is a devastating disease with a poor prognosis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represent different forms of lung cancer that are associated with distinct genetic causes and display different responses to therapy in the clinic. Whereas SCLC is often sensitive to chemotherapy at start of treatment, NSCLC are less chemo-sensitive. In NSCLC different histological subtypes are distinguished and increasing efforts are made to identify subtypes that respond to specific therapies, such as those harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations that have benefit from treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Targeting of the apoptotic machinery represents another approach that aims to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal ones. Here we describe different ways that are currently explored to induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells, specifically pathways controlled by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), BCL-2 family members and apoptosis inhibitory proteins (IAPs). Preclinical studies are discussed and for some agents results from early clinical studies and future perspectives are considered.']

['Assessment of insulin sensitivity (S I) and glucose effectiveness (S G) from a standardized hyperglucidic breakfast test in type 2 diabetics exhibiting various levels of insulin resistance.', 'We investigated the measurement of insulin sensitivity (S I) with a standardized hyperglucidic breakfast (SHB) compared to minimal model analysis of an intravenous glucose tolerance test (S I-IVGTT) in 17 patients clinically referred as type 2 diabetics, not yet treated by insulin, and representing a wide range of body mass index and S I. To classify the patients, ten meal-tolerance test-based calculations of S I (MTT-S I) were compared to S I-IVGTT, and their reference values and distribution were measured on a separate sample of 200 control SHBs and 209 control IVGTTs. Eight MTT-SI indices exhibit significant correlations with S I-IVGTT: Mari\'s OGIS index, BIGTT-SI|0-30-120, BIGTT-SI|0-60-120, 1\\/G b I m, Caumo\'s oral minimal model (OMM), Sluiter\'s index "A"?=?10(4)\\/(I p·G p), Matsuda\'s composite index given by the formula ISIcomp?=?10(4)\\/(I b G b I m G m)(0.5), S I?=?1\\/I b G b I m G m with r (2) ranging between 0,53 and 0,28. S I-IVGTT and S I-MTT exhibited in the lower range a very different (non-normal) pattern of distribution and thus the cutoff value for defining insulin resistance varied among indices. With such cutoffs, S I-MTT?<?6.3?min(-1)\\/(μU\\/ml)?10(-4) with Caumo\'s OMM was the best predictor of insulin resistance defined as S I-IVGTT?<?2?min(-1)\\/(μU\\/ml)?10(-4). Other indices, including OGIS and BIGTT, resulted in more misclassifications of patients. HOMA-IR and QUICKI were poor predictors. The formula [Formula: see text] satisfactorily predicts IVGTT-derived glucose effectiveness in type 2 diabetics. Thus, SHB appears suitable for the measurement of S I and S G in type 2 diabetics, and the OMM seems to provide the most accurate SHB-derived index in this population.']
['Flecainide-associated bradycardia-dependent torsade de pointes: another potential mechanism of proarrhythmia.', 'Although flecainide has a risk of proarrhythmia in patients with structural heart disease, its mechanism has been mainly ascribed to use-dependency and a rapid ventricular response to organized atrial tachyarrhythmias or to ventricular tachycardia. We present a patient who experienced recurrent syncope due to bradycardia-dependent torsade de pointes (TdP) associated with flecainide-related bradycardia and QT prolongation. Bradycardia-dependent TdP with QT prolongation can be considered as one of mechanisms of flecainide-induced proarrhythmia.']
['[Resurfacing of a trochanteric pressure sore by a pedicled fasciocutaneous anterolateral thigh flap: a case report].', 'The anterolateral thigh flap is usually used as a free flap for various kinds of reconstruction and resurfacing of distant areas. Cover of a deep trochanteric pressure sore is commonly made by muscular or musculocutaneous flaps such as tensor of fascia lata or vastus lateralis. We report the case of a trochanteric pressure sore covered by a fasciocutaneous pedicled anterolateral thigh flap after negative pressure therapy in a 58-year-old paraplegic patient. After 6 months, a good quality of coverage was obtained with minimal morbidity of donor site. The pedicled fasciocutaneous anterolateral flap appears as a reliable option for the treatment of trochanteric pressure sore.']
['[Aortodigestive fistula and septic wound of the lower leg. A case report].', 'An aortodigestive fistula can be revealed by a peripheral septic wound when patient have aortic endovascular prosthesis. Our clinical case is about a 69-year-old patient with an abscess of the lateral aspect of his left lower limb. He has been treated few years ago for an aorto-abdominal anevrysm by an aortobifemoral prosthesis. In spite of a negative initial assessment for an aortodigestive fistula, anaerobic germs were found into the abscess. The initial treatment associated debridement, negative pressure therapy, dermal substitute and a split thickness skin graft for the loss of cutaneous substance. Months later, in front of an unexplained skin healing delay and fever, we realised new assessment bringing to light an aortodigestive fistula. Furthermore, the local bacterial samples from the wound and the hemocultures found both a lot of Escherichia Coli. The change of the aorto-bifemoral prosthesis and the cure of the aortodigestive fistula allowed the complete healing of the loss of cutaneous substance of the leg. The aortodigestive fistulas have a very high mortality. Because of their difficult diagnosis, their clinical suspicion has to start a complete medical assessment. Every septic wound when patients have vascular prosthesis is suggestive of an aortodigestive fistula.']
