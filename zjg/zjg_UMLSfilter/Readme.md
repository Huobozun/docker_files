首先需要将工作路径移动到zjg_UMLSfilter，该路径下有一个文件夹/file，其下又有两个文件夹/before和/result,其中/before用来存放需要进行过滤的UMLS文件，/result用来存放过滤结果  

/before下的UMLS字典针对的就是UMLS的字典格式，需要满足如下的格式要求（因为本过滤过程中用到了UMLS字典的类型和来源信息，所以本过滤功能仅适用于UMLS字典过滤。如要进行其他词典过滤，请从gitlab中的代码进行修改，自行完善）

[SEP] chromosomal constitution of cells which deviate from the normal by the addition or subtraction of chromosomes or chromosome pairs. [SEP] The chromosomal constitution of cells which deviate from the normal by the addition or subtraction of CHROMOSOMES, chromosome pairs, or chromosome fragments. In a normally diploid cell (DIPLOIDY) the loss of a chromosome pair is termed nullisomy (symbol: 2N-2), the loss of a single chromosome is MONOSOMY (symbol: 2N-1), the addition of a chromosome pair is tetrasomy (symbol: 2N+2), the addition of a single chromosome is TRISOMY (symbol: 2N+1).

[SEP] Drug-, radiation-induced, or spontaneous injuries to DNA that introduce deviations from its normal double-helical conformation. These changes include structural distortions that interfere with replication and transcription, as well as point mutations that disrupt base pairs and exert damaging effects on future generations through changes in DNA sequence. If the damage is minor, it can often be repaired (DNA repair); extensive damage can induce apoptosis. [SEP] Injuries to DNA that introduce deviations from its normal, intact structure and which may, if left unrepaired, result in a MUTATION or a block of DNA REPLICATION. These deviations may be caused by physical or chemical agents and occur by natural or unnatural, introduced circumstances. They include the introduction of illegitimate bases during replication or by deamination or other modification of bases; the loss of a base from the DNA backbone leaving an abasic site; single-strand breaks; double strand breaks; and intrastrand (PYRIMIDINE DIMERS) or interstrand crosslinking. Damage can often be repaired (DNA REPAIR). If the damage is extensive, it can induce APOPTOSIS.  


将需要过滤的文件放到/before中后，只需运行UMLSfilter.py就可以完成词典过滤，会在/result文件夹中生成两种类型的文件：  
allshow_filteren.tsv中记录了每个文件过滤出的词条以及本词条所在处的词条信息  
以'Filtered_'开头的文件对应着/before的文件，记录的是过滤词条后剩下的词条文件，与/before中的格式完全一样，只不过删掉了过滤词条信息。  
！！请在使用完成后将本次前后过滤文件移出/file文件夹，否则在下次使用还会再过滤一次
